"There’s a lot to enjoy here in a well-rounded package, with plenty of replay value thanks to the range of different heroes, collectibles and high-scores to aim for, as well as the online and offline multiplayer options.",8
"Like ZEN Studios' previous offerings, Zen Pinball 3D reproduces the best aspects of pinball beautifully, and the 3D truly adds to the enjoyment and gets you that much closer to feeling like you're playing real pinball.",7
"The Great Escape is saved by a few good set-pieces and the licence, but it's hard not to feel hard done by. Those willing to endure yet another stealth game could find their morale ebbing away by the end of this. [Sept 2003]",4
"The gameplay of Puzzle Bobble never gets old, and in Everybubble it’s no different. Popping bubbles is just as much fun as it was in the 1990s: almost 30 years later, and it’s as enjoyable as ever. Puzzle Bobble Everybubble offers up a well-rounded package with plenty of modes to jump into, with Baron’s Tower and the joyous Space Invaders twist giving players reason to keep jumping back in long after the story mode has been completed. What’s not to like, really?",9
"For something intended to be played many times, Error Unknown has a tendency to drag on. It would have benefitted from tightening up, each ‘run’ lasting fewer days in order to maximise novelty and minimise repetition. But despite having more than a few bugs in its execution, Tech Support: Error Unknown just about qualifies as a minimum viable product. Ticket completed.",5
"In motion, it's a painfully beautiful game: in the saturated richness of its colours and the raw exuberance of its backdrops; in the soaring melody of Magical Sound Shower and the husky elocution of the girl who voices the menus; in the hard, brilliant, arcade brashness of it all; above all, in the unique balance and beauty of its handling.",9
"Sports Bar VR is fun for the price. It's super cheap and most of the games work ok. The biggest annoyances come from moving around the bar, and re-positioning yourself to better play the game.",6
"Röki pretends to be smarter - and more emotional - than it really is. As hard as it tries to impress and touch, it left me feeling as if I had eaten a plate of stale pickled herrings. Röki has gameplay and pacing issues but the biggest annoyance is that the lovable character you will play as has not been given any humanly worth beyond her obsessive mission. Maybe I take things too emotionally but overall, when reaching the unfortunately cliched ending after 14 hours of playing, I felt I could have spent that time better. While I enjoyed the game in parts and admired its enchanting look, it left a sour taste in my mouth.",4
"I highly recommend playing Go Mecha Ball — just know that it’s more limited than it might seem on the surface. I’d probably feel better about the game if it were a short, linear experience with crafted levels instead of a roguelike, and in its current form, just a few small updates to add a bit of variety would be enough to pique my interest again. Even now, I’m certain that I’ll be dusting it back off in a few months when the experience isn’t so fresh in my mind. As a way to spend a few blissfully chaotic nights, it’s hard to do better than Go Mecha Ball, even if it falls a bit short of greatness.",7
"Despite its lack of cooperative or PVP gameplay, I don't think it's hyperbolic to say that this is an essential game for 2022. Blending two opposing styles into an expertly executed bullet ballet, Rollerdrome's future is anything but dystopian.",9
"It's the kind of game that a family can enjoy together, and perhaps is best in that sense. Ironic gen-Xers and urban wiggers probably won't get much from it, but then that's why games like Need For Speed and GTA exist. [PC Zone]",6
"After its stormy development, FF12 isn't just a worthy installment of the series, but a great RPG in its own right, one that thinks differently and feels all the better for it. [JPN Import; June 2006, p.72] Stunning Design. [Feb 2007, p.66]",9
"It's easily one of the better titles on the system. If you've any love for electronic music then the soundtrack alone is probably worth it, but as a puzzler there simply isn't anything else around that even comes close. Essential day one stuff.",8
"I can safely recommend NBA 2K23 to every sports games fan, even though the microtransactions are extremely aggressive. The gameplay is too good, and I hope future updates won’t break it.",9
"Californium is a pitch perfect visualization of the death rattle of the hippie dream, a glimpse into worlds locked behind the liquid dreams of acid. It is also suffers from design and pacing flaws that take away from the overall experience and limit its audience.",6
"For fans or even gamers just interested in action hack n' slash games a like, you can't do wrong to invest some time in Wolverine's latest gaming outing, for the most part it offers up a visceral ride of gory action.",8
"Need for Speed Unbound brings plenty of style and builds upon the high stakes dynamic established in 2019’s Heat to create an engaging and enjoyable open world racing game. The large emphasis on story falls flat once again particularly during the slow opening hours, and the online mode lacks some of the best aspects of the single player mode, including police and Takeover events. Fortunately, the excellent performance and smart overhaul to the turbo system ensures the moment-to-moment gameplay always feels great, and the huge amount of unlockable vehicles, customization options and optional activities and collectibles means there’s always plenty to do each time you make the trip to Lakeshore City.",8
"You know you've found a great puzzler when even the earliest levels in the game leave you feeling completely rewarded. Crush accomplishes this feat thanks to its 40 superbly-designed mazes, fantastic art style, and terrific original concept.",9
Even when it hits the $20 bargain bins it's still going to be a bad game. I can't stress enough that if you have a PC remotely capable of playing Mafia then please get the PC version.,9
"With around 40 mini-games included Raving Rabbids: Alive & Kicking, the biggest highlight of this game is how well some of these games work, especially with the Kinect controller which has copped some flack over the last year.",2
"Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the culmination at all levels of the current Action RPG. An immense, brave and ambitious work, capable of giving the best possible homage to the original classic while introducing its own vision.",7
"After playing this game, I don't think I will even think I'll ever lay eyes on rollercoaster tycoon again even if it did just launch onto the Xbox not to long ago. I think I will stick with this game.",10
"If you are more into structured RPGs or adventures with a little more plot, story, and character interaction...you may want to run to the video store for this one and see if it's for you.",7
"Nebuchadnezzar is not as great as Pharaoh, the legendary city builder in whose footsteps it follows. However, it’s an interesting game that will satisfy your desire to build ancient cities, even if it relies too much on burdensome micromanagement. [05/2021, p.40]",5
"Why are so many missions so dull? Why is the combat-radio voice work so insipid? And which unemployed sports commentator and soccer mom did the tutorial and combat voices, respectively?",6
"I can see the kids (the younger the better) enjoying some of the byplay between Hornball Harry and the jaguar, but if they manage to get that far with the awkward controls and loopy camera, then they&#146;re pretty strong gamers for their age. Skip this one.",3
"Rabbids: Alive & Kicking is definitely a unique approach to playing around with those mischievous critters. Much of the insanity and charm is back along with some new physical gameplay that might prove a bit too much for those, like myself, who come unprepared.",4
"While it is one of the better looking first-person games to come out this year, it isn’t the most technically savvy. The gameplay isn’t perfectly honed, but an ever-changing mix of clever ideas, evocative locations, and engaging characters tap the best traditions of the Western genre.",6
"With weak exploration which tends towards being more tedious, and even exhausting, combat which trips over itself to constantly interrupt the player, and an overall feeling of awkwardness in the presentation, getting through The Thaumaturge's low moments can be a real struggle. However, on the other side is a compelling and interesting political slow burn which weaves the role of magic and Thaumaturgy into real historical scheming, even if that means the more interesting aspects of the world take a backseat. This is alongside an engaging core combat loop and some excellent creature designs. If you can stomach the slow start and are willing to play into the game's more obtuse aspects, particularly the walls of emotive text, The Thaumaturge is sure to be another exciting CRPG for you.",7
"Mini Motorways is a game that I can just vibe with. There was a period of time when I’d boot Mini Metro every single day in order to undertake the daily challenge. I can see that being the case again here. There’s an intricate, impossible-feeling balance to this game; it is fiendishly difficult and filled with tactical nuance with even things like the angle of how roads join one another impacting traffic speed - and yet it is also joyously mellow and inviting, the perfect way to whittle away some spare minutes. I can barely say a bad word about it.",8
"The improved out-of-car experience, better gun handling, added driving-and-shooting mechanic, and the slew of changes all culminate in this being a much better outing that ""Driver 3.""",7
"There are certainly problems with the title, but the same gore and humor from the movies is intact for the game, which is key. Fans will love hearing their hero back in action again, and while short lived, will enjoy taking down the deadites as well.",6
"If Telltale can figure out a way to weave together all of the possible branches in the story to create a second season (and beyond), then that will hopefully make all of the doom and gloom from the first season more worthwhile. But if Telltale has painted themselves into a corner, and this season is it, then I wouldn’t recommend the game at all, unless your idea of fun is getting punched in the face repeatedly.",3
"A Total War Saga: TROY does a good job in retelling the events of the Trojan War by using interesting elements from Greek mythology as well as the Iliad. However, there were times where the controls felt a little stiff, such as troop organization. The game also doesn’t meet its full potential graphically. That said, battles are simplistic to play but difficult to master. Since there are different lead characters to play as, TROY offers plenty of replay value as well as a chance to enjoy some Greek mythology on each run. It's not a perfect game, but fighting the Minotaur is too cool to pass up.",7
"The Great Escape is saved by a few good set-pieces and the licence, but it's hard not to feel hard done by. Those willing to endure yet another stealth game could find their morale ebbing away by the end of this. [Edge]",4
"This is the sort of game that seems destined to go down as a cult classic, but should really be enjoyed by anyone with a 3DS system. It’s a true triumph of gameplay over spectacle, and a hugely engaging experience from start to finish.",9
"Concord may not be worth $40 to some, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t $40 worth of game here. With PlayStation levels of production value, and exceptional gameplay, fans of hero or team-based shooters should find Concord appealing – if they give it a chance.",8
"A dodgy camera and touchy controls can be fixed. I know I wasn't the only one at E3 who told the producer that the camera was a mess. But, alas, they shipped this most stylish and most gore-riffic game with its major problems still intact.",5
"Taken individually, each section of Hell Yeah! could be called derivative. Put them all together, and the game as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It may lean toward the easy side, but for anyone who grew up during the 16-bit era, Hell Yeah! hits all of the right notes.",7
"And that's what South of Midnight is: an unapologetic love letter to the American Deep South; specifically, the gothic vibes that permeate the mythology and superstitions of the region as well as the history and culture of the people who live there. It doesn't exactly wow with its combat and platforming, but these parts of the game are mechanically sound, and South of Midnight's memorable characters, incredible visuals, and catchy soundtrack are so strong that it doesn't really matter that the gameplay is just decent. South of Midnight is the type of story that will sit with you, and a good reminder that we need more games about the American Deep South. Compulsion Games hasn't made a direct sequel to any of its games yet, but it needs to make an exception here--I am not done with this world.",8
"While Onimusha: Warlords may be an older game, I believe it has stood the test of time fairly well, and has gotten me interested in checking out the later entries. The game is thoroughly enjoyable the whole way through with very few dull moments. Overall the game, albeit a short one, provides a great experience that culminates into a strong title.",7
"While Four Quarters’ title operates under the trappings of casual gaming, I’d say that Loop Hero works for quick sessions, and also as a more dedicated experience that might keep one up for long hours into the night. It cherrypicks the right elements from each of the genres it takes inspiration from, and gives back a completely fresh experience with oldschool appeal.",8
"Developed by Krillbite Studios and an indirect sequel of their previous game The Plan, Sunlight brings an exciting perspective on walking simulators. Far from replicating the environments in their past work such as the terrorizing atmosphere in Among The Sleep or the dreadful cities in Mosaic, this relaxing narrative adventure displays a more natural aesthetic, with both the auditive and visual aspects in it being genuinely delightful.",8
"A hurried game that attempts to borrow a previously successful formula and use it to boost franchise sales. Well, this reviewer says they’re going to have to try a lot harder than this to create fans.",3
"Far from the appeal of a Fallout 3, Metro Last Light bets on a really dark and nerve racking post-apocalyptic ambiance. This undoubtedly is the strong point of the game, but not the only one. The latest 4A's Games subtly mixes gunfights, stealth approach and storyline that confirm the literary roots of the script. Offering good immersion despite some minor problems with the AI, the game leads the player in a very intricate world. A world where the beauty of the graphics allows to forget about the drawbacks mentioned, especially on PC with potent graphics cards where the game can be put through its paces. If the fans of Metro 2033 will swear at the distribution method of the ""Ranger"" mode, they can be reassured, Metro Last Light is as good as it's prequel, and maybe even better.",9
"One of the more unfortunate things about this game is that for a supposedly comical kart racer, the drivers’ personalities rarely come through. At its worst, NASCAR Kart Racing stands out as little more than a marketing opportunity in a sport already filled with them.",4
"Onimusha: Warlords HD Remaster is intended for those looking for a trip down memory lane, but it won't impress others. It's an interesting historical artifact, but that's about all it has going for it.",4
"Sorry We're Closed beautifully takes that otherworldly psychological horror of games such as Silent Hill and puts its own colorful spin on things, resulting in a game filled with an eye-popping visual style, a terrific story with a clever look at relationships via angels and demons, and an amazing cast of characters, including one truly memorable and unsettling villain, alongside a lot of other surreal and spooky moments. While the combat may be a tad frustrating later on, it all still makes for a great entry into the genre and definitely one to pick up.",8
"This addon offers new challenges for veterans as well as improvements for beginners. Actually it's optimizing the whole game, not changing a lot, just making it better and more fun.",6
"The video game monster of Dr. Frankenstein, Valkyria Revolution is a huge pile of dozens of mismatched, poorly designed systems, bland presentation and poor design choices all over the board. It bears no similarities to its wonderful predecessors apart from an interesting plot, which is unfortunately torn apart by the thousands of cutscenes and loading screens.",2
"Darksiders 2 is a series of peaks and valleys, but you spend more time at the top than you do in the pits below. More importantly, you spend even more time climbing and descending, claiming treasures and delving into the most dangerous parts of the world.",7
"While it may not be the most groundbreaking of shooters, Emergence's merits far outweigh its smattering of faults, and with six to ten hours of entertainment to be had, you can't argue that it's not value for money, especially as it also comes bundled with a copy of the original SiN. Eleven quid you say? Bargain.",6
"There's an awful lot of gaming to be had here. While the updated version of the first Dead or Alive is only worthwhile for nostalgia's sake, the revamped DOA2 is a graphical masterpiece, and a blast to play online.",7
"Dynasty Warriors Strikeforce definitely has the same appeal (or lack thereof depending on your point of view) of its predecessors, but its long list of characters, upgradable attacks, varied weapons and bonus missions gives the series the kick in the ass it has so desperately needed for the last few years.",7
"Crappy graphics, but surprisingly enough it's a hardcore simulator game of the world fastest motorbikes. This title will definitely please those steering handlebars fans. The rest of gaming population will most likely get frightened by the game's requirements. [Issue#232]",5
"While not quite on a par with the PS5’s best graphics, it does a wonderful job conveying the actors’ emotions. And the storyline is tightly written and compelling. You’ll want to get onto the next episode. The gameplay is basic and only time will tell how the choices you make play out over the next four episodes. So for now, episode one is a good start. Very much a Telltale interactive story. And if you’re down with that and not too much actual gaming you’ll be satisfied.",7
"The base gameplay is decent, although the inclusion of power-up attacks and platforming obstacles only serves to muddle the experience, making success feel more like a matter of blind luck than skill.",5
"As engrossing and deep as Gallop Racer 2006 is, it's still a horse-racing simulation, after all. This severely limits the appeal of the game, as most people are probably more interested in managing a football franchise or a baseball team than a horse farm.",5
"When it comes down to it, The Darkest Faerie plays like a Zelda knockoff and looks like a Spyro ripoff. Save for the mote system, there really isn't anything interesting going on, which would be fine if the execution were better.",4
"The game felt easier just because of the fact that it holds your hand throughout the journey, and acts like a set of training wheels until the end. That doesn't mean the game isn't fun though.",6
"While I’m surprised that Just Dance 2014 continues the tradition of not letting us import our old tracks, it offers plenty of new features to make the series innovative instead of iterative.",6
"Yes, I have had some issues with Ronin, but I’ve still had fun. Enjoyable and frustrating this game may be, when all is said and done, there isn’t anything quite as satisfying as surprise tossing a thug out of a tenth story window and watching him sail into the darkness.",6
"In the end, Yonder is undeniably a fantastic game to sit back and chill with. If you're looking forward to some exploration, collection, and light building and farming elements, then Yonder is definitely right up your alley. However! There should be a heavy emphasis on ""light"" in the sentence up above! This is not the next Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley. No, this is a game with few puzzles, no combat, and filled to the brim with fetch quests and item collection. Yonder isn't without its charms, to be sure. But deep and engaging game play (and story) definitely isn't one of them.",7
Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles is a delightful little game that can appeal to players of all ages and skill levels. The island of Gemea – complete with its atmospheric weather and seasonal cycle – makes for the perfect destination if you're looking for a relaxing virtual vacation.,6
"The action is tremendously addictive and will keep you coming back for more. The most pleasant surprise was the mature plot and gruesome execution both literally and figuratively. It deals with the nature of war, the heavy toll it inflicts and those callous opportunists who see it as a business and humans as merely a commodity.",7
"While RPG Maker Fes is not the best at what it does, it certainly is very capable in doing a lot despite of its disadvantages. It also serves as a learning tool to give users interested in game design. There is great potential for user-created content in RPG Maker Fes, but similar to many user-driven games, the quality of the games are entirely at the hands of the community.",8
"I enjoyed this game up until the halfway point. Then, the sheer lack of any really new gameplay mechanics and the amazing repetitiveness of collecting really got to me. [July 2002, p.40]",6
"There are just a few things wrong with this game, like repetitive land battles, horrible AI and no save options that lead me to the conclusions that no one should get this game. There are plenty of great pirate games out there, if you want a good one look elsewhere.",6
"Crimsonland is exactly one video game: a perfectly competent twin-stick shooter, and nothing else. Unfortunately, the title’s quests feel a bit half-baked, and the whole thing could do with a facelift.",4
"If I could give Beyond Eyes more stars, I would. Rarely does a character emotion become so pronounced in my own being. When Rae was delighted, I’d laugh with excitement. When Rae was scared, I cowered alongside her. When Rae was upset I was quite literally found sobbing in the fetal position until the wave of emotion passed.",5
"The game seems to lack an overall level of polish, as you'll see some questionable AI and some occasional bouts of slowdown in the PS2 version of the game. Still, the gameplay itself is rock-solid.",6
"The game's strong points remain the atmosphere and the script, but if you're not willing to compromise when it comes to graphics and game length, you won't be able to enjoy the two things the producers got right.",5
"Pac-Man World Re-Pac is a fun look Pac in time to an era where 3D platformers were far more prominent than they are today. While it doesn’t quite outclass some of its contemporaries like Crash Bandicoot Warped and Super Mario 64, Pac-Man World isn’t one to miss if you’re looking for another solid 3D platforming adventure. Depending on how you view the new difficulty balances (or if you just really love Ms. Pac-Man) this is undoubtedly the best way to experience the PS1 classic.",6
"Once you get past the (incredibly frustrating) first hour or two, earn some cash, and buy or upgrade a few cars, it's an OK combat-racing game that's hamstrung by its appalling camera and handicapped AI, and both of those sabotage any satisfaction you might actually get from the game.",7
"Batman: Arkham Knight is a game that shows what can happen when a talented development studio is completely invested in a fictional universe and has mastered the technology to bring it to life. We’ve become the Batman before, but never quite like this.",4
"You shouldn&#146;t need double-jointed thumbs nor the kind of patience required to endure its faults. As it is, I can only recommend Mafia to those that for one reason or another cannot play the game on the PC. It isn&#146;t a bad game, it&#146;s just not all that it could be.",10
"If you&#146;ve played ""Final Fantasy Adventure"" and were looking to have as great of an experience with this game, you might be a little let down. Thankfully, Sword of Mana does not continue the downward slide that the Mana series seems to be suffering from in recent installments.",5
Riptide offers what Dead Island’s fans were waiting for: a “more of the same” splatter-gory gameplay with some tiny additions... but not enough to give everyone else something to remember!,6
"For all its early indulgence in balls (and the suggestion of which that line of “comedy” might head in), Ballhalla is still at its heart a clever little marble-rolling puzzler with plentiful moments of delightful frustration.",6
"Namco Museum is a fantastic self-contained package with an interesting offering of games that arcade fans will enjoy tearing into. It's found a suitable home on the Nintendo Switch. While it isn't rife with the ""virtual museum"" content previous games in the series back on the original PlayStation offered, it is a solid and feature-rich compilation title that's worth its asking price.",7
"The glaive is something that every action nut has to wrap his or her hands around. Like the BFG or the cerebral bore, you’ll remember this weapon forever. Sadly, you’ll remember the weapon more than the game itself.",7
"Following to the letter its own formula in terms of gameplay, controls, structure and open world design, Forza Horizon 5 becomes the new pinnacle of the franchise due to the special way that it transports us to the beautiful Mexican landscapes, taking harnessing all the power of the Xbox Series X to become one of the first games of this new generation that undoubtedly feels like a new generation. Some rough edges at the level and interface and progression slow it down from true perfection, but its virtues overshadow those flaws and of course, make it one of the best games of this 2021.",9
"Bad controls, horrible voice-over (it's just as cliche as it was last time), and the trademark and annoyingly pervasive EA Radio will tax not only your brain, but also your ears. Soccer may be a beautiful game, but it's about time to kick FIFA Street 2 to the gutter.",4
"Overall, I started the game with a bit of skepticism since I was only familiar with it’s turn based system which I quite enjoyed for the setting it was in, as it presented you with time to think and was more of an RTS, tactical kind of approach which I enjoyed greatly. At first it was a little odd to adjust to, but the faster pace gameplay fits the setting better than a turn based system would with all the options for combat they’ve put in and it actually gets quite addicting to play the different class roles, I miss the old play style, but I can enjoy both quite easily so I don’t feel I’m losing out. The games’ value is great too at $59.95 upon release, I’m actually quite pleased it’s not more, it’s around the average price for this kind of game, but in a world where a lot of games are $80+ for base editions and $100+ for special editions it’s a welcome bracket to fit into.",8
"It doesn’t raise the bar regarding the RTS genre’s standards and it doesn’t really come close to the existing ones, even though it does feature certain innovations over the previous titles of the series. Nevertheless, it’s a game with a solid universe for the background story, a large fan base, more than decent single-player campaign and, in regards to the graphics and sounds, it most certainly can go toe to toe with any RTS released in these last two years.",7
"A quality party game, so it's a real shame that the biggest new feature - the Quest mode - is so poor. And good though it is, it's only worth getting if you missed the previous one or you're an obsessive completist. [April 2006, p.86]",6
"Despite the high overall level of polish, Assault Heroes 2 feels like an overlong expansion pack - and at $10, it's one that costs twice the price of the original. Good game? Yes, but a tough sell.",6
"Crimsonland feels like an incomplete game. It has all the gameplay mechanics in place, but its backgrounds, character assets, music, and general presentation look and sound like they were put in for testing purposes while awaiting the real art and music to arrive. The twin-stick shooting at the core is fun, but the experience can’t help but be diminished by nearly every other aspect of the game.",5
"Punching healers in the face is fun, pulling people across the map is fun, cutting people up from behind is fun… Stunlock Studios basically took everything good about arena and hero combat and put it all together into one game. They removed the grind, the items, the buildup… and everyone is on the same level playing field.",8
"No pun intended, but Part Time UFO is the very definition of a pick-up-and-play effort. You know… pick up… with a claw… Ahem! Anyway, it's rewarding for short bursts and designed very well for this kind of play, with a level of polish not found in some other 'short burst' titles. It also saves some of its best surprises for the endgame.",7
"The new single-player story mode and bonus games add a little more longevity to the game, the fundamental experience is still largely the same as that offered in previous Mario Party games. If you bought ""Mario Party 4"" last year, Mario Party 5 is hard to recommend.",6
"NBA 2K23 suffers from an identity crisis. On one hand, it respects basketball fans like no other game ever has in the franchise; on the other, it continues to disrespect NBA 2K players. For every triple, there's a foul; for every fantastic detail in recreating the old NBA eras, there's a microtransaction barrier. A title that does so much right on the court manages to become practically intolerable when trying to play online. Our advice? Cherish the offline.",7
"GRIP: Combat Racing is an unpolished gem that’s currently too flawed to fully recommend. When it comes together – particularly in multiplayer – GRIP is capable of providing some of the most engaging future racing this side of Wipeout 2097, but it’s all too easy for it to fall apart, especially when you’re placed in the hands of the game’s cheating AI.",6
"It's not entirely free from the monotonous grind that's so common to the genre, but the more repetitious moments are balanced by bursts of fun personality and outrageous antics that keep up the zippy pace. [Nov 2012, p.85]",7
"This game simply serves as a letter to fans with enough of a stockpile of guilty pleasure moments stacked up throughout that any true fan must buy this game, sadly everything is lost on anyone that hasn't devoted serious time to at least several of the titles this game borrows characters from.",6
"Persona 4 Dancing All Night is a delightful departure from the series norm, and even fans that only have a passing knowledge of the franchise will get a kick out of how fun P4DAN really is to play.",7
"Those looking for a reboot of Ridge Racer or for something which may resemble the iconic Namco Bandai series will become dissapointed, but anyway Unbounded is a good racing game, which control you may love or hate, a bit limited in single player content but with a great potential for used-created content in the multiplayer mode.",8
"No, you won't find volumes of content or progressive new ideas, and the forced touchscreen controls are a minor strategic bungle. However, the well-paced single-player campaign is punctuated by a strong and varied weapon set and online multiplayer that hits an unprecedented level of quality for a handheld.",7
"The First Berserker: Khazan is one of the toughest action games and soulslikes in recent years. It's relentlessly punishing, with challenging spectacle fights and bosses to overcome. However, each challenge you do topple leads a sense of satisfaction that harkens back to the genre’s origins when everyone was less experienced at these games. That combat is only let down by a somewhat overwhelming story for newcomers to the Dungeon & Fighter (DNF) universe, a lack of accessibility options besides an easy difficulty, and a gear crafting system that feels unnecessary.",7
"A great game. Because of the differences from previous iterations it may be a little disappointing to die hard Mario Kart purists. But for anyone who likes the series in general, the decision to get this game is a no-brainer.",8
"Succeeds where ""Rollercoaster Tycoon"" and even ""Sim Theme Park"" failed&#8212;it gives you the true sensation of riding a rollercoaster, the logical tools to build them, and the ability to show your work quickly and easily.",7
"I have to say that overall I was pleasantly surprised with Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team. From the great visuals and sound, to the addictive gameplay, this is a pretty good XBLA title. The only thing that hurts this game somewhat is the short gameplay length and lack of online cooperative play. That being said, fans of twin-stick shooters, and fans of the Warhammer universe alike, will enjoy this title.",7
"Despite its impressive audiovisual presentation, it fails in the areas that make a game a game. It is beautiful in its own dismal way, and the story it tells is decent, but I could not wait for it to end so I would not have to deal with the frustrating control and dull design decisions.",6
"Imagine Buzz, but more colorful, with more ways to play and controlled with a phone. We’ve had a great time playing with friends, and if you enjoy this type of quiz show-like game, it’s worth your money.",7
"I still have major concerns about the game's combat, but Age of Empires: Definitive Edition is a good history lesson for what inspired me and so many others to love RTS genre so much. It’s a brilliant game with a ton of content and for such a low entry price, I think it’s worth a look even if it’s not perfect.",7
"Bellator: MMA Onslaught has very nice graphics and good A.I. It's just a shame that the animations are so clunky and bad. It feels like MMA Onslaught isn't a finished product, because of the few options and the horrible animations.",5
"An incredible mix of exploration, story, and setting, South of Midnight certainly resonated with me. While its individual parts mightn’t be groundbreaking, the way in which Compulsion Games has combined them certainly is. This is definitely one worth checking out.",8
"Forza Horizon 5 sets a new industry gold standard for racing game visuals, gameplay, and map design. Our expectations of map design just leveled up with Horizon 5, and it’s another massive victory for Game Pass members who will get it on release day. The good news for players is that there’s future DLC content to come, which will only add to what is comfortably the most exciting next-gen racing game released so far.",9
"NBA 2K23 is the Michael Jordan of the basketball games. Stunning visuals, improved gameplay and the additions of Eras to the MyNBA mode and the Jordan Challenges make it a must-have for basketball fans. The only issue with NBA 2K23 is an old one: microtransactions. But, if you're a 2K fan, you already know that.",9
"But if you're not a fan of this genre, don't be fooled by the hype – this is a solid rail shooter, but it's certainly not worth spending your money on, especially in this crowded and star-studded holiday shopping season.",8
"Thunder Blade is well done arcade port with lots of options that help to modernize the experience. Like most other old arcade games, personal interest is really what drives the game’s value. For players who either remember the arcade original or simply enjoy the style, it’s definitely worth checking out.",6
"We absolutely loved Final Fantasy VII Remake, but it's safe to say that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth surpasses it in every possible way. It's a masterpiece. It tells a grander tale, with more twists and turns that keep you on your feet. And while some new story elements may rub some players up the wrong way, they keep things feeling fresh, and make us keen to see where Square Enix will take things next. Ultimately, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has exceeded our expectations, building on the original game and indeed Final Fantasy VII Remake, delivering a sequel that feels bigger and better in all regards.",7
"An alloy of several winning gaming formulas, combing great graphics, wonderful sound, and deep, engrossing game play. And though it may not appeal right away to those of short attention spans, given a chance, you&#146;ll find yourself being sucked into it, enjoying it to its fullest extent.",10
"Though The Sexy Brutale fumbles a few times -- especially near the end when it rushes toward a narrative payoff -- it never hurts the experience. Uncovering the mansion's secrets and the twisted plot that dooms its guests is exciting. Compared to almost any other puzzle game, The Sexy Brutale's dark tone and inspired art stand out from the crowd. Solving murder might not be the most cheerful work, but it's one hell of a good time.",9
"Warhammer 40.000: Kill Team is brain off, guns out. The ""Orc slicing"" is fun especially at the beginning but is more and more running out of air the further you get. Warhammer fans may consider a buy everyone else should probably keep his/her axe at home considering a 800 MS Points price point.",8
Nothing but a copycat of the original Tropico game comes with small arrangements like a road building system or 3D visuals. Yet it is a catchy and reliable “dictatorship” game. [Nov 2009],6
"I fear my childhood has prevented me from giving Nebuchadnezzar a fair chance. It was never going to meet my expectations because I was holding it up to a level of quality that few have been able to match in the past 20 years. This isn't a bad game; it just not one that you'll remember in a year, forget a decade. So instead of recommending this, I recommend you instead spend half as much and buy Pharoah instead.",6
"I just can't find any redeeming qualities in this game. It's not overly exciting, it looks almost exactly like the original Grand Theft Auto, only much smaller, and the game lacks any humor or interesting content.",5
"All in all, Trek to Yomi is a pretty solid game if a little short. I won’t fault a game for being single-digit hours long, as long as it delivers a good story; Trek to Yomi certainly did. As mentioned prior, the additional story path options potentially take the game up to a good probably 10 hours, assuming all are approximately the same. The challenge offered by completing the game on higher difficulties can also invite a challenge to squeeze a few more hours out, and the combat is fun enough to welcome a playthrough just for difficulties sake.",3
"Although the first wave of the Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass was a bit underwhelming, the release of the second wave, Side Order, makes the DLC an absolute must-have for Splatoon fans and those who are fond of the roguelite genre. The Splatoon IP has always primarily focused on online multiplayer, but Side Order further proves that its single-player offerings shouldn’t be overlooked either. If you already own Splatoon 3, getting the Expansion Pass is a no-brainer for the price, but if you don’t, now is a better time than ever to join in on the splatastic fun. Splatoon 3: Expansion Pass is available now via the Nintendo eShop.",7
"Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue is the best way to discover Dream Drop Distance (if you didn't play the original) and a wonderful teaser for Kingdom Hearts 3. But the wait, supposed to be easier, is now worse. ¡Come on, Nomura! ¡Bring it on!",6
"Darksiders II is an absolutely outstanding experience, the combat is fluid, the story is well written, the RPG elements add a lot of depth and the side quests will add many extra hours to your time with the game. As we enter the twilight of the 360's life, this really is a stand out game of the highest quality.",9
"Ultimately, Atari Flashback Classics is a fine collection. The sheer quantity of entertainment software is reason enough to warrant a look. Alongside certified arcade greats, is a wealth of middling-to-fun Atari 2600 and 5200 titles. Even those that weren't around back then will probably be able to find something that they can really connect with, with one example being the previously-unreleased Aquaventure. Of course, considering the era in which these were made, it might be extremely difficult to garner any appreciation for what's here. Still, it is a valuable time capsule for those who weren't around for gaming's infancy.",7
"Hotline Miami is a prime example of how awesome indie game can be. It's creative, it's free spirited and it's cool as hell. This really is a must to buy for fans of highly original games.",9
"I was addicted to Boyfriend Dungeon for the two days I played it. While the game is not without flaws, I do wish that it had been longer. While having multiple flings in Verona Beach was a delightful romp, it always felt like there should have been more content than there was. However, I had so much fun playing this game, even when it became uncomfortable I still felt compelled to see where the story would go and how the characters would develop. Boyfriend Dungeon is the right kind of weird that keeps you wanting just one more dungeon run, even when it stalls out on you way too early.",8
"Derivative to say the least, Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death clearly owes God of War for many of its characteristics. Nevertheless, it's an entertaining ride while it lasts and a good example of how, sometimes, action games can lean just on their button-mashing basis to be fun.",6
"And in declining to make any kind of meaningful statement about its environmental themes, After Us only demonstrates that, like its protagonist, it has nothing to say for itself. [Issue#386, p.116]",4
"Depth delivers thrills, making you feel like a dangerous hunter or a target. It's a nice change of pace from more traditional multiplayer games. It's only a shame that there's not more content.",7
"It's fun, it's got appeal to comic book fans, it's got appeal to game fans far beyond the limits of Street Fighter, the online play is well put together, and the game constantly looks and sounds great.",8
"It's a game that's just incredible fun, mixing in all sorts of gaming ideas with the thrill of the real sport, painting a final touch of extreme excess and color for scintillating effect. [Nov 2003, p.86]",8
"Diablo 2: Resurrected is, if anything, a faithful remaster of the original game. The visual overhaul and fantastic cinematics maintain the dark tone of Sanctuary’s horrifying demons and tales. Unfortunately, that alone doesn’t hold up after 20 years of innovation. Annoying gameplay mechanics, constant selling and buying, restrictive controls, regressive character art, and finicky UI poorly date this adventure. More quality of life changes should be here to truly bring the classic back to life. Diablo fans may love this remaster; others will likely not.",7
"This game has it all: monsters to capture and raise, upgradeable items and spells, and incredibly rich character customization. I got sucked in to this as badly as I did with both ""Final Fantasy Tactics,"" so that's saying a lot: 50-some great hours, lots. [June 2004, p.97]",9
"How these french bakers succeeded to create a good mix between an epic story, billiards, squids and rpg games, it's still a mystery. Anyway, they did it. This is one of the best indie games on Wii U e-shop.",9
"I wanted to love this game, I really did; the first stage showed so much promise but the lack of content and variety cemented this as an average game with a killer soundtrack and lofty aspirations.",6
"Underneath the intriguing concept and gorgeous graphics, The Waylanders has a somewhat meaty tactical experience wrapped around the bare bones of an RPG. And while it may be light on the actual role-playing elements, there’s enough of a unique spin in terms of story, setting, and battle system that those who prefer mechanics above anything else might have a good time. This is by no means Baldur’s Gate nor Dragon’s Age: like King Ith’s Tuatha de Danaan, those gods aren’t here. I can recommend The Waylanders, but only if expectations are managed accordingly.",6
"Although some may have fun with Rabbids: Alive and Kicking, the overall package is far from optimal. When your load times last longer then your mini games that poses a major issue. If you were looking at buying this game because you enjoyed the Rabbids games that are on the Wii, Alive and Kicking kicking doesn't live up to the bar set out before it.",5
"Although Hard West 2 delivers on some awesome visuals and sound design, its gameplay didn’t hook me and its characters never grew on me. For those looking to scratch the itch of a turn-based tactics game until a wave of games releases in the fall of 2022, then this could be right up your alley.",5
This could be that rare case in which a game inspires players to give their well worn controllers a break and pick up a paperback for a few nights instead. That alone makes Metro: Last Light worth putting on your wish list.,7
"Purists will decry the changes made to Majora’s Mask no matter how slight they may be, but I am seated firmly in the “change is good” camp. It’s everything you remember, but without the boredom or frustration related to the passage of time.",8
"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is a generous and inspiring remaster, finally bringing the game’s visuals in line with its outstanding narrative. It truly feels like this is now the game Monolith Soft always intended it to be, cementing its position as one of the greatest RPGs of all time.",10
"From a presentation standpoint, Showdown is an excellent additional to the Shovel Knight kingdom, but with multiplayer being restricted to couch only, it doesn’t hold up as well as its platforming brethren.",7
"With nothing in common with the original, Yars' Revenge is a terrible bad incarnation of the original classic. Hopefully Atari will learn from this mistake and do something better the next time they decide to to a HD remake of one of their classics.",5
"Concord is too daring a gamble for Firewalk and PlayStation Studios, who are releasing a 100% multiplayer pay-to-play game in a pool of already famous free-to-play games. While the game isn't fundamentally bad, it's slower and less dynamic than its rivals, which will hold some players back, and in no way revolutionizes the genre, which might have justified the entry fee. The game aims to be that “hero-shooter for casuals par excellence”, but does this genre have a place in today's ecosystem, and a paying one at that? Unfortunately, it's hard to see a bright future for Concord without some radical rethinking.",3
"I was really pleasantly surprised at the tremendous amount of content I was able to get for such a small price and even more pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had with it. If you're looking for something to workout your mental muscles and don't want a plot driven game, then I can't more highly recommend Quarrel.",4
"Quarrel is an interesting mix between Risk and Scrabble where you must conquer the enemy territory using anagrams. It's a nice game that can keep you playing for a long time, if you tolerate its frustrating AI that sometimes gives the sensation of cheating.",8
"The biggest problem with Grand Theft Auto Advance is that the game is so big and there is no in-game map to be found. There is the typical radar which has your mission points, but you won't be able to know where the hospital is, for example.",8
"And holy cow, if it's sheer bat-guano crazy you're after, you'll love Versus mode. Pick from 45 (!) unlockable characters and square off against 11 other nutjobs (humans or bots) in completely ridiculous battle royales over Live. We'd happily pay 10 bucks just to listen to the chaos in each wild melee.",4
"Shovel Knight Showdown proves that Yacht Club Games is capable of making more than just platformers, as it’s delivered an entertaining and content-rich multiplayer brawler that’s sure to be a house favourite to many. Plenty of game modes, a long cast of characters, and a bevvy of unlockables ensure that this is a release that you’ll be playing for quite some time – although we would add that it’s a game which is best enjoyed with others on hand. Though single-player options are present, they fail to provide enough of a reason to justify this release as a standalone product, and we’d sooner direct you to one of the other Shovel Knight campaigns if you intend on mostly playing alone. Either way, Yacht Club Games continues to impress with its support for Shovel Knight, and we’d highly recommend you experience Shovel Knight Showdown one way or another.",9
"I'm totally for the idea of a nonviolent FPS, but this one just doesn't work on any level. It's like ""Catechumen's"" long lost pagan brother. It doesn't even make a good game for your kid brother or son who's hopped up on Atlantis fever. This is one empire that deserves to stay lost.",9
"Phantasy Reverie Series is a relatively no-frills remaster collection. There's a couple of quality of life improvements and the games have a fresh lick of high definition paint, but if you didn't like Klonoa back in the day then you're not going to like it now. If you didn't play Klonoa at the time then you won't have the prerequisite nostalgia goggles necessary to gaze upon these games and see them for anything more than what they are — a couple of pretty good platformers and little else, and that's fine.",2
"Jurassic World Evolution was never a perfect game, but there were some fans of the Jurassic Park franchise that felt it was worth their time. Despite the shallow simulation aspects and repetitive tasks forced on them, many players still enjoyed creating and admiring the various dinosaurs in their park. Because of the poor graphics on the Nintendo Switch version of Jurassic World Evolution, however, there is little here to keep players entertained - and those interested in the premise are better off revisiting its previous platforms instead.",6
"One of the big problems with making a cheap side-scroller is with the addition of garbage AI, the game is just a lot of run from Point A to Point B, with the beat-up people areas providing barriers.",4
"It uses many stereotypes, brings them to the maximum and keeps us in a world of political incorrectness, showing us hard environment were life is worth nothing: Wild West from cinema and literature enters Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood, turns into a videogame and is still recognizable in all its elements, making the most of the spectacle of the medium.",3
"Rollerdrome is an incredible arcade shooter that combines fluid movement with addicting mechanical loops which encourage you to pull off visually appealing stunts with ease. Though your mileage may vary be you a high-score chaser or not, it never fails to be fun, and Rollerdrome is more than worth a look for any arcade shooter lover.",7
"The phrase ""one for the fans"" has never been applied more honestly than in this case; it may be flawed, but we're happy to recommend Rise of a Ninja to Naruto fans - albeit with a few reservations. Believe it.",9
"Concord provides a highly enjoyable and satisfying FPS experience, but needs more time in the oven if it wants to succeed in the highly competitive hero shooter and live-service market.",6
"Although it could have been much better than it actually is, Final Fantasy XIII-2 proves to be a well-crafted product that compensates for gamers' disappointment over Final Fantasy XIII.",7
Trek to Yomi is presented like a very different type of video game experience and that's largely attributed to its presentation. Flying Wild Hog went into this project with the goal of making a playable samurai film and they've capably accomplished that objective.,7
"A few hours in, you'll likely find yourself scratching your head as seemingly impossible puzzles best you. This can naturally be frustrating, especially as you move so slowly, but you'll feel like a genius once everything clicks. Many stages have optional bonus challenges once you solve them, earning you collectable scrolls complete with philosophical mumbo-jumbo. The main story is more interesting, told wordlessly through a series of dioramas, but it's the puzzles themselves that will keep you playing. It's not exactly original, but The Sojourn is a solid puzzler with well designed levels and some nice ideas.",8
"AiRace Xeno doesn't do anything we haven't seen before, but it's a finely-crafted time-attack racer that's well worth the low price for fans of sci-fi racing, with luscious visuals and a bumpin' soundtrack.",7
"Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 is just like the console version, but thanks to the stunning screen of Vita it is also more beautiful. The touch functions definitely work but could make the complex combat system too easy and unbalanced.",7
"Unless you happen to be an enemy of all things cool and funny, the first installment of Strong Bad is where it's at. This new monthly series shows tons of promise, and the next episode, Strong Badia the Free, looks even more delightfully ludicrous.",8
"Hunt the Night has good core mechanics and an interesting universe to explore. But this is the kind of experience that will cause frustration and players need to be ready to deal with that. A big time and energy investment are needed to master combat scenarios, especially when bosses are involved. Both the world and the presentation are good enough to keep players interested. There's also nothing better than finally winning a fight you've previously lost tens of times. Hunt the Night could have used a few extra concessions for newcomers but it's one of the best top-down combat-focused experiences for players who want to be challenged.",7
"If you&#146;re into what we call the thinking man&#146;s (or woman&#146;s) RTS, you owe it to yourself to check out Homeworld 2. If you&#146;re tired with the seemingly never-ending stream of first person shooters, give it a try - chances are, you will enjoy every bit of this as we have.",8
"River City Saga: Three Kingdoms is a side-scrolling brawler developed with love, full of humor and surprisingly rich in content. You won’t find a more charming series in this genre and Three Kingdoms shows how much you can still squeeze out of it by improving its formula.",8
"As beautiful and serene as After Us is, it tells a painful story of a world destroyed by the impact of humans. As you save each animal, the darkness that plagues the environment grows more pronounced, and you’re left wondering if this is a world even worth saving. This adventure will pique the curiosity of any player through its clever platforming sections, environment design, and strong narrative message.",8
"A brilliant fantasy turn-based strategy which borrows the best parts from those who came before. You’re going to manage cities in the vein of Civilization, fight battles reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic, but mainly you’re going to lead your people and shape them through magical evolution, resulting in a myriad combinations and playstyles. This is what a fun, addictive strategy game looks like.",9
American role-playing veterans who aren't absolutely dying to do turn-based battles on their shiny new console are advised to wait for a true RPG killer app on 360 -- however long that's going to take.,5
"The graphics are as beautiful as ever, the presentation is immaculate, the story keeps you gripped and your brain will appreciate the workout before you go back to killing it with beer, cheesy Wotsits and Hollyoaks. [PC Zone]",9
"Despite the amazing scope and intensity of the battles (during the Omaha Beach offensive I’ve burnt 750 German tanks and killed 17500 soldiers), there will come an inevitable moment when Officers becomes boring and turns into Blitzkrieg 2 on steroids.",6
"Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers is game made for the fans. With around fifty characters to play as, three full story modes to experience and a netcode worthy of the modern age, it’s a title I feel hardcore fans of the series can enjoy.",7
"Intriguing – despite a mounting pile of evidence showing that it should be terrible. The characters and story are so outlandish and bizarre that they are fascinating – but the nonsense and clunky mechanics never coalesce into a satisfying experience. It lures you in with the promise of something unique, then botches the execution.",5
"Ultimately not a bad game, just ""too casual"". Definitely enjoyable for many, especially younger players, gamers with lives or those who actually prefer the simplicity. For a hardcore reviewer like me, the gameplay is unfortunately just too simple, repetitive and unchallenging.",6
"An interesting choice if you long for a proper challenge, and you don't mind there's no feast to your eyes. However, if rogue genre says nothing to you, take a different road. [Issue#232]",6
"The newest installment of Bohemia's military-game is a product with great potential, especially from the community’s side. Unfortunately Arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. It's a game that lives through the community.",5
"Yonder is beautiful and relaxing, but only up to a certain point. It's great for the first few hours, wandering around and discovering new sights, but the world ultimately leaves you wanting more depth and personality to explore.",6
"Packed with a bevy of features, TimeSplitters Future Perfect is a cornucopia of candy-coated goodness for any FPS fan. If you start now, you just might be able to unlock everything by the time ""Halo 3"" ships to stores.",9
"When trying to sum up this game's single-player missions, the first phrases that come to mind are hopelessly outnumbered, completely surrounded, and best hide behind a big rock quick.",6
"Critter Café first hour exudes coziness as you begin collecting creatures and decorate your modest coffee house. But soon, it becomes painfully apparent that the developers did not flesh out their designs. The next eleven hours are filled with routine sokoban puzzles, playing four basic mini-games, and seeing the game’s eponymous animals not do much of anything. Do not squander your time with this one.",3
"Overall, you can't really expect a whole lot from Kill Team in terms of diversity – at it's core, it's a hack and slash/twin stick shooter with slight RPG elements. While I had a lot of fun with it, one can only hope THQ will branch out, show us more of the grimdarkness of the 40K world, and fix a few technical snags along the way.",6
"Singstar Ultimate Party is a fail, and the main part of it is because of the very bad quality of the smartphone app and the lack of true multiplayer mode which would involve more than two singers.",3
While the missions are well planned - important considering it’s called Th3 Plan - the cheesy dialogue and the 70’s synth-bass feels like they were all stolen from some bad movie that never wanted them in the first place.,5
"Final Fantasy's final swan song for the PlayStation 2 is a complete masterpiece. Square Enix's attention to detail and love for their craft is embodied through and through. This is an adventure that will, without a doubt, stand the tests of time.",9
"A great combination of genres that manages to really tax your brain, be great fun and work as a competitive and addictive multiplayer game. Not so great for solo players, though. [Issue#83, p.104]",7
"Essentially, Ratatouille would be a perfect purchase for somebody fitting any two of these criteria: a young child, somebody relatively unskilled at gaming or a huge fan of the film on which the game is based.",5
"The great sound, variety of characters, deep tactical options, and a neat ability-learning system will ensure that fans of the strategy-RPG genre will not be disappointed. Overall, La Pucelle: Tactics is a well-crafted gem that is clearly a labour of love from Nippon Ichi.",8
"This atmospheric puzzler/platformer takes you to a 50s dystopia. Playing as a kid with a little brother puts boundaries on you to go wherever you want freely. Monochroma is a great first start for the studio, but brings nothing new to this genre.",6
"Onimusha: Warlords for Nintendo Switch is a delight. It looks and plays well, it’s fun, and the in-game achievement system – aptly named Honors – motivates the player to replay the game several times. On average, most will be able to complete the game in around four hours. Despite the short duration, the journey is a quality one and something you’ll want to replay. Hopefully, Capcom has plans to bring the rest of the Onimusha series to the Nintendo Switch in the near future.",9
"Paleo Pines is overpriced and not worth it, because it doesn't come close to good farming sims or cozy games like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley. The graphics and animations are lackluster. In addition, many mechanics are very tedious and annoying. The only unique factor, the cute dinosaurs, is simply not convincing enough to outweigh the flaws.",3
"The Driver franchise isn't quite ready for a bullet in the head, but it's definitely tired. Atari needs to let the series take some time off until there's a compelling non-financial reason to produce another installment, and Reflections should do some soul-searching to figure out which parts of the game work.",5
"Running around thwacking enemies feels fun enough, but poor A.I. renders your other party member nearly useless - you'll often have to switch between them just to keep them from getting killed. [Feb 2004, p.128]",6
"A fantastic game. I thoroughly enjoyed spelunking through the game’s massive world, and even though the story can get lackluster, it does excel when it tackles its religious themes.",6
"It's a case of missed opportunity with Castlevania Judgment. The concept sounds so enticing, but it doesn't take long to realize that the series has not done a good job of creating memorable characters. It tries to implement creative ideas, but nothing really clicks and both die hard fans and fighting game enthusiasts will be discouraged by gameplay that's anything but immortal.",8
"This is a solid game overall -- and without a doubt, All-Pro Football should continue building on this foundation. But if you were expecting 2K euphoria after two years on the sidelines, you'll be disappointed, as this one's got rust in many of the wrong places.",4
"This is a good example of how to bring a movie to consoles. In terms of gameplay, it's quite solid. Visually, it fulfills with honor. Raven Software has proven it can bring Marvel licenses to a good end.",6
"Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team is a fun, simple blast-a-thon that goes a little beyond typical twin-stick shooter mechanics with its classes and upgrade system and it takes place in one of the coolest settings in all of gaming.",7
"Vol. 1 still has bouts of incredible monotony, but with the increased speed of the battles and graphics that don't induce nausea, it makes for a fine -- but not really great -- role-playing adventure.",5
If you've always fancied the idea of having the genuine OutRun arcade cabinet experience with added online support then OutRun Online Arcade does exactly what it says on the tin while managing to be a lot of fun to boot.,8
"Folks, there is a lot to this game; it might not be a pure railroad / train management simulator, but it has a lot to offer, especially if you like puzzles. Everything runs very smoothly, and I didn't find any bugs. Some of the missions will require you to start from scratch where you need to locate resources, build or rather place the appropriate resource gathering buildings, assign the necessary workers and lay down rails, place stations, set the switches while adding the needed trains and its cars. Other missions might provide a jumbled-up mishmash collection of broken rails that need to be fixed and improved. Every mission will be different from the previous ones.",7
"The difficulty curve is spot-on but storytelling pacing could be better and more emotional. With core game play that becomes as monotonous as you'd expect, the side-stories needed higher stakes for more emotional investment.",6
