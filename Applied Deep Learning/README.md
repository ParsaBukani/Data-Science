# Applied Deep Learning

_Data Science — University of Tehran_  

This folder contains the fourth set of projects from the **Data Science course**, focusing on practical applications of **deep learning models** across multiple domains.  
Students designed, trained, and evaluated neural architectures for structured data, image classification, and time-series forecasting.  

## Overview  

- **Football Match Outcome Prediction (MLP)**  
  A **Multi-Layer Perceptron** trained on historical football match data (World Cup qualifiers & Qatar 2022).  
  The model predicts match outcomes and provides insights into influential features.  

- **Flower Classification (CNN)**  
  Image classification task using two approaches:  
  - A custom **VGG-style CNN** trained from scratch.  
  - A fine-tuned **ResNet** pretrained on ImageNet.  
  Performance of both models was compared to highlight benefits and trade-offs.  

- **Bitcoin Price Forecasting (RNNs)**  
  Time-series forecasting of Bitcoin prices using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**.  
  Historical OHLCV data was transformed into supervised sequences, with experiments on both **RNN** and **LSTM** architectures.
