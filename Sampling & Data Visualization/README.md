# Sampling & Data Visualization  

_Data Science — University of Tehran_  

This folder contains the second set of projects from the **Data Science course**, focusing on **stochastic sampling algorithms** and **visual data storytelling**.  
The assignments combine probabilistic modeling with modern dashboarding tools to explore both the theoretical and practical aspects of data analysis.  

## Overview  

- **Langevin Dynamics Sampling**  
  Implementation and analysis of the Langevin Dynamics algorithm to study sampling efficiency, convergence, and distributional properties.  

- **Interactive Dashboards (Tableau)**  
  Construction of dashboards with **KPIs, filters, and parameters** to create a structured, interactive data story, applying best practices in visual analytics and design.
