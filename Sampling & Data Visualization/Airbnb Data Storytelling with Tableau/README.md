# Airbnb Data Storytelling with Tableau  

_Data Science — University of Tehran_  

This project uses **Airbnb listings and neighborhood data** to build an **interactive data story** through Tableau dashboards.  
The aim is to explore pricing, availability, and geographic trends, while applying **best practices in visualization design**.  

## Tasks  

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Import `Airbnb_Listings.xls` and `Neighborhood_Locations.xlsx`.  
   - Join datasets on neighborhood fields.  
   - Ensure each record includes **latitude & longitude** for mapping.  
   - Handle missing values appropriately.  

2. **Dashboard Creation & Storytelling**  
   - Build at least **three dashboards**, each exploring a distinct perspective (e.g., pricing by season, spatial distribution, host activity).  
   - Add **interactive filters, parameters, and KPIs**.  
   - Connect dashboards into a **cohesive narrative flow**.  

3. **Insights & Narrative Structure**  
   - **Introduction**: define focus of analysis.  
   - **Dashboards**: highlight complementary insights.  
   - **Conclusion**: summarize findings — including when patterns are absent or unexpected.  

4. **Design Principles**  
   - Apply **Gestalt Principles** for layout and grouping.  
   - Use **preattentive attributes** (color, size, position) to emphasize important insights.  

## Deliverables  

- Tableau Public **link to dashboards**.  
- PDF report including:  
  - Screenshots of dashboards.  
  - Short narrative explaining insights.  
  - Description of filters, parameters, and KPIs.  

## Evaluation  

- Data integration and preprocessing.  
- Dashboard design and interactivity.  
- Strength of narrative and storytelling.  
- Application of visualization principles.  
- Team participation and clarity of explanations.
