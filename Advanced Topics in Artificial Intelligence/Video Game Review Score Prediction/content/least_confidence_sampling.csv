"Those hoping for 90° Kirby won’t get it in BoxBoy, but those looking for BoxBoy—puzzle-solving, muted box-making extraordinaire—need not look any further. Kirby is not up to this task. Unless, of course, Kirby eats BoxBoy and acquires his powers. Then Kirby might do just fine.",8
"For something intended to be played many times, Error Unknown has a tendency to drag on. It would have benefitted from tightening up, each ‘run’ lasting fewer days in order to maximise novelty and minimise repetition. But despite having more than a few bugs in its execution, Tech Support: Error Unknown just about qualifies as a minimum viable product. Ticket completed.",6
"Rainbow Skies is the new game from SideQuest Studios, and an indirect sequel to Rainbow Moon. This is an old-school tactical RPG with tons of quest and characters to collect and develop.",7
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms is the umpteenth demonstration of the unfortunate union between gamepad and strategic games. The developers have thought of a great product, with many potentialities on paper. The title is destroyed by the bad mapping of controls and a not so impressive technical realization.",4
"Batman Arkham Knight is the best entry in the series. Rocksteady knows perfectly how to explode the formula established years ago, making amazing additions in terms of gameplay. You must play this game.",9
"If Troy isn't the best Total War, it's one of the most convincing Total War Saga games. Overall the recipe for the IP doesn't change much, which is a bit sad for newcomers, but will delight the fans of the series.",8
"After playing this game, I don't think I will even think I'll ever lay eyes on rollercoaster tycoon again even if it did just launch onto the Xbox not to long ago. I think I will stick with this game.",7
"There are more than enough game variants here to keep you happy, playable in a convoy of fully customisable off-road vehicles and across some really detailed and expansive terrain. Check it out, it's the ultimate backseat drive.",7
What the…? The original fascination we had with the franchise as a well rounded karaoke party game is gone. From all that was good almost nothing remains. I want my old SingStar back.,3
"MC II should ship with a free sample of Ritalin. The amount of concentration required to maintain control of your car at such incomprehensibly high speeds almost requires some sort of chemical assistance (just joking kids). [June 2003, p.66]",6
"Although it could have been much better than it actually is, Final Fantasy XIII-2 proves to be a well-crafted product that compensates for gamers' disappointment over Final Fantasy XIII.",7
"Fans of Starship Troopers and PvE shootouts should definitely have Extermination in their sights. It offers successful PvE multiplayer, where the piles of dead arachnids that remain there fascinate. However, there could have been more maps and singleplayer is boring and not even Casper Van Dien can save it.",7
"The detractions are small but numerous. The poor handling of branded aftermarket parts, lack of real-life tracks, and tediousness of switching from racing to tuning are tops in the small flaws department.",5
"A cursory glance at Dragon Throne often urges people to write it off as an ""Age of Empires"" clone. However, it is a sophisticated RTS title and handles its many layers much better than comparable RTS titles.",7
"For hardcore baseball simulation fans, I have no problem recommending MLB Power Pros 2008 – but for families looking for an extension of Nintendo’s incredible Wii Sports, I would recommend looking towards titles like Little League World Series 2008 or Mario Super Sluggers that fully embrace the Wii’s model and functionality.",7
"Despite the shallow graphics, the new Supreme Ruler is a solid and incredibly depth strategy game that will appeal to every fan. On the other hand the new players will be overwhelmed by its complexity due to the complete lack of a tutorial.",6
"Much like TV's Strictly Come Dancing, Just Dance 2014 adopts the same tried and tested formula that has seen it become one of this generation's premiere party games. It doesn't take any risks and fails to innovate, but thanks to its superb soundtrack, hilarious dance routines and much-needed online mode, it's worth dusting off those dancing shoes for one last jive.",6
"An alloy of several winning gaming formulas, combing great graphics, wonderful sound, and deep, engrossing game play. And though it may not appeal right away to those of short attention spans, given a chance, you&#146;ll find yourself being sucked into it, enjoying it to its fullest extent.",8
"If you hated its predecessor you will surely not warm up to this sequel. On the other hand Serah and Noel do a lot better than Lightning and her friends in Final Fantasy XIII. Here's more to do, more to discover, more roleplaying.",7
"From storytelling to game design, Those Who Remain's tepid approach to its overabundant tropes made me want to leave Dormont as soon as I arrived. My best advice to horror fans: ignore the exit—even if your tank is running low.",4
"Packed with a bevy of features, TimeSplitters Future Perfect is a cornucopia of candy-coated goodness for any FPS fan. If you start now, you just might be able to unlock everything by the time ""Halo 3"" ships to stores.",8
"Unfortunately the only thing that differentiates Kill Team from other twin-stick shooters is the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The game is very short and you can find fault in its every element. [August 2011, p.72]",6
"Like ZEN Studios' previous offerings, Zen Pinball 3D reproduces the best aspects of pinball beautifully, and the 3D truly adds to the enjoyment and gets you that much closer to feeling like you're playing real pinball.",7
"The gameplay of Puzzle Bobble never gets old, and in Everybubble it’s no different. Popping bubbles is just as much fun as it was in the 1990s: almost 30 years later, and it’s as enjoyable as ever. Puzzle Bobble Everybubble offers up a well-rounded package with plenty of modes to jump into, with Baron’s Tower and the joyous Space Invaders twist giving players reason to keep jumping back in long after the story mode has been completed. What’s not to like, really?",8
"Scooby-Doo: Mystery Mayhem just isn&#146;t much fun. Blame it on its repetitive nature, the bad level design, the lame gameplay mechanics, the poor controls, or the collection mentality that composes a large part of the game &#150; blame it on something because there&#146;s no denying that Scooby-Doo: Mystery Mayhem is a huge bore-fest.",8
I wasn’t much a fan of episodic content before this game. I didn’t think they could include enough to warrant a $20 price tag but SiN Episodes: Emergence has gone a long way towards disproving that assumption.,5
As annoying as the high tolerance level and missing error analysis are: Just Dance 2014 is the best rhythm game when it comes to the pure joy of moving to music – especially in a group.,7
Nothing but a copycat of the original Tropico game comes with small arrangements like a road building system or 3D visuals. Yet it is a catchy and reliable “dictatorship” game. [Nov 2009],6
"Sadly, even loading an MP3 of ‘90s favorite “Mr. Jones” by Counting Crows didn’t make any of these four music mini-games and passive experiences any less boring or more bearable. If my friends came over to check out my new $400 VR headset, Harmonix Music VR is the last thing I’d want to show them.",6
"Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time represents the show it is based on incredibly well when it comes to the look and the characters. That’s all it gets right, though, as the gameplay is just frustrating and tedious.",7
"I just found Monaco hard to enjoy. I was either rushing to reach a checkpoint before guards killed me or I was roaming aimlessly, being booted back to the beginning of the level when I died too many times. Monaco very rarely hits that stealthy sweet spot - that sense of quietly and carefully infiltrating enemy territory, knowing that you're vastly outnumbered and you'll be killed if you screw up. Instead, it usually just tests your patience.",5
"Beautiful, involving, impeccably designed and outstanding value, this is a grand game that is difficult to fault. It will captivate even those who have been immune to Final Fantasy's spell.",9
"It is a work of staggering genius, delicate like a snowflake, yet rugged like a prizefighter's face. SSX3 doesn't just demand your attention, but commands it, turning heads like a Hollywood celeb mozeying through Rochester Tesco's.",9
"While it's complexities edge a tad too close to convolution at times, 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII' was a great time once I wrapped my head around it all. The steps towards accessibility, while far from perfect, definitely make this the most user-friendly entry in the series, and the amount of options available to players is hugely appreciated.",9
"All the visual improvement and added content can’t camouflage the handheld origins, which in return means that all the design and content shortcomings of the Vita version are still there.",7
"The gameplay isn't smart, the customizing RPG elements aren't very complex, and the story isn't presented with the kind of flair that Shirow Masamune's manga has inspired in film, on TV, or even in previous videogames.",7
"Despite the high overall level of polish, Assault Heroes 2 feels like an overlong expansion pack - and at $10, it's one that costs twice the price of the original. Good game? Yes, but a tough sell.",5
"Is Turok 2 better than Dinosaur Hunter? I don’t know if I’d call it better, but it’s certainly different. Personally, I prefer the original game but I appreciate how different this sequel is, even if I’m not a huge fan of every single point of divergence. Certainly, the level design leaves something to be desired, and while Turok wields a healthy armament by game’s end, there’s a cruel practicality to virtually every weapon. The Cerebral Bore is great, but it’s a one-enemy gun. Dinosaur Hunter had the Particle Accelerator and Fusion Cannon, both of which wiped out entire landscapes of enemies. This may be a consideration for Turok 2’s more closed, corridor-heavy environments, which is another thing I don’t love about it. However, the enemy designs and overall uniqueness of the environments really is special.",7
"The single-player missions don't take long to beat and the game's multiplayer lacks depth. Armored Core 4 should keep robot lovers busy, but it failed to improve nearly as much as expected.",7
"Concord may not be worth $40 to some, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t $40 worth of game here. With PlayStation levels of production value, and exceptional gameplay, fans of hero or team-based shooters should find Concord appealing – if they give it a chance.",5
"Sonic Rivals still stands head and shoulders over other recent efforts in the franchise - and, indeed, over many other recent PSP titles - simply because the game at the heart of it all is downright fun.",9
"Rock Band 3 is simply perfect. It's the final evolution of the music games, the perfect harmony between game and study, the perfect party experience and an awesome game. Everything is packed with love and attention, from the smaller thing to major features. If you love music and videogames, buy it and love it.",10
"Full Motion Video, the return of Joseph Kucan, the introduction of a third race to play, and the incredible competitive multiplayer package really shows just how much was spent to make this game the best production possible.",9
"Creating a superpower from Haiti isn’t an easy task but it sure was a fun run, I recommend SuperPower2 to people that like world simulations or to people that wish they could run any country on earth in anyway they see fit.",8
"A Total War Saga: Troy, the third game in the series, is the best in all aspects, not only in terms of graphics and technical execution, but also in gameplay and the challenges we encounter during the campaign.",10
"Yes, it's better than Final Fantasy XIII, but the legendary franchise needs more than that. Fans of FFXIII will probably be happy with this one, but older gamers will be disappointed.",7
"Life is Strange is not perfect, but it has a soul, and that's something quite rare those days. If you like this new Telltale-like adventure genre, Life is Strange is one of those games you don't want to miss.",8
"Fans of the new TV series and even older fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will enjoy this title, provided they can ignore the skateboarding and other driving sections of the game.",7
"From bedrooms containing clever and mysterious moving panels to a 'Land of the Giants'-style pool challenge, each section delivers something new and exciting to motivate deeper exploration. [Apr 2004, p.110]",8
"From bedrooms containing clever and mysterious moving panels to a 'Land of the Giants'-style pool challenge, each section delivers something new and exciting to motivate deeper exploration. [Apr 2004, p.110]",8
"When I was done, I was disappointed that I couldn't start it up all over again as like any adventure game, there's no real replayability here, but ultimately I was glad that I got to spend time with these characters and set up endings for them that allowed them to be as happy as they had made me.",6
"It both loves and hates the player, and this degree of love or hate depends on the type of player. Some could find its frustrations unforgiveable, while others will delight in its cornucopia of exploratory offerings.",6
"Joyful and strange, Wattam’s a hard game to explain, but not a difficult one to play. Once it wraps you in its welcoming arms you won’t want to let go. Until you end up kaboomed, that is. [Issue#171, p.90]",8
"The change of engine in Monster Energy Supercross 25 - The Official Video Game will bring, in the medium and long term, the necessary benefits to a franchise that was clearly stagnating. But the current version of the game still relies on its old qualities in gameplay, while suffering from the same limitations in both the visual presentation and the conservatism of the game modes.",6
"Anything that was good about Armies of Exigo is irreparably ruined by the woefully cliché story, simplicity, repetitive mission objectives and often dimwitted AI. I would have forgiven it all that, if only it hadn't been so boring.",3
"Great idea, poor execution. It's a common story, but this was supposed to be an uncommon game. Hopefully things will turn around should a sequel pan out, but the first Death's DOA.",4
"While I wanted a few more quality of life improvements and would've liked more visual improvements or consistency, what Monolith Soft have put out in Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition is nothing short of spectacular.",9
"All in all, Trek to Yomi is a pretty solid game if a little short. I won’t fault a game for being single-digit hours long, as long as it delivers a good story; Trek to Yomi certainly did. As mentioned prior, the additional story path options potentially take the game up to a good probably 10 hours, assuming all are approximately the same. The challenge offered by completing the game on higher difficulties can also invite a challenge to squeeze a few more hours out, and the combat is fun enough to welcome a playthrough just for difficulties sake.",8
"In truth Wolverine could have scored higher simply due to more time being allowed for bug testing, and possibly having no association with the terrible film. But that doesn’t prevent it from being a good solid, and ultimately, fun game.",7
"Puzzle Bobble Everybubble! is a good game, and it’s absolutely fine fare if you don’t already own a version of Taito’s venerable series. The new quirks don’t break anything fundamental, and that’s for the best in terms of maintaining series quality. At the same time, the new modes don’t add a lot.",7
"Harmonix Music VR is a half-hearted compilation of four tech demos that are interesting for less than a minute apiece. With so many other things to try on PSVR for a similar price, you’ll feel short-changed if you waste your money on this.",3
"Digital distribution may never replace retail sales, and episodic content may never become the standard for all games, but the future of both is startlingly bright. Sin Episodes is among the first to fling itself into that future. Though common in its gameplay, it is also enjoyable: had it been ten bucks instead of twenty, I'd be raving.",8
"My experience with Age of Mythology was one of apathy and boredom... Think of AoM as Led Zeppelin&#146;s ""Stairway to Heaven."" Sure, it&#146;s a great song, but do you really want to hear it over and over again?",5
"The limited playing areas and the auto targeting do detract from the gameplay, but hours could be spent simply customising your mech, let alone unlocking all of the machines that the game holds!",7
"The trouble is doing any sort of action requires using 3 or 4 menus, which is okay in itself, but in InuYasha: The Secret of the Cursed Mask, each menu takes twice as long as it needs to, dragging the battles horridly. Combined with a fairly high encounter rate, it seems to take forever to accomplish anything.",4
"Online play means that even solo players are able to go up against real opponents, but there aren't enough great mini-games in the collection to warrant more than one or two plays through what is on offer.",5
"The game seems to lack an overall level of polish, as you'll see some questionable AI and some occasional bouts of slowdown in the PS2 version of the game. Still, the gameplay itself is rock-solid.",7
"If I could give Beyond Eyes more stars, I would. Rarely does a character emotion become so pronounced in my own being. When Rae was delighted, I’d laugh with excitement. When Rae was scared, I cowered alongside her. When Rae was upset I was quite literally found sobbing in the fetal position until the wave of emotion passed.",9
"To date, there aren’t a whole lot of games like Monaco. There’s action oriented isometrics like Trap Gunner and strategy heavy games like Frozen Synapse, but Monaco succeeds in blending the two playstyles together effortlessly. Even if you aren’t the type who plays nice with others, Monaco offers more than enough content to help you channel your inner thief.",8
"An epic RPG quest that rewards patience. It's slow-paced, but once you're strong enough to tackle the bigger monsters it really shines. Just don't expect anything ground-breaking. [June 2006, p.81]",8
"The only other problem I found with the game was the challenge that the in-game camera presents. Often, you will find yourself using the camera buttons a lot to move the camera so you can see everything in the environment.",6
"Nebuchadnezzar is not as great as Pharaoh, the legendary city builder in whose footsteps it follows. However, it’s an interesting game that will satisfy your desire to build ancient cities, even if it relies too much on burdensome micromanagement. [05/2021, p.40]",6
"It's not a bad game, but casual gamers, and possibly hardcore-traditional-football fans, may get bored of pulling tricks rather than pulling skilled corners back on the real pitch.",6
"The pacing is bad, the activities are boring, the Vision Camera is an annoyance and handcuffs the entire experience, and the payoff for all of your hardships isn’t fulfilling in the slightest.",3
"Dead or School often intrigues in appearance, but never quite capitalises on the unique blend of the mundane. Technical issues bog down the core experience, and the lack of restriction or respect for the rest of the content sours what could have been a thoroughly enjoyable romp through the underground.",4
The grid-less combat can be annoying to get used to—especially when learning how to properly position characters—but there’s enough small changes to put a good spin on otherwise stale tactical combat.,7
"They really don't make games like Hell Yeah anymore. It's one of the most random and oddball games I've played. It's one of those games where a bunch of wildly creative developers got together, had a bunch of fun, and made a game without ever asking ""why?""",8
"The Stronghold series isn't like Total War, doing a hundred different things; it just needs to get the castles and combat right. On the evidence of Stronghold Crusader 2, Firefly is moving in the right direction, but it still has a way to go.",7
"NBA 2K23 is the Michael Jordan of the basketball games. Stunning visuals, improved gameplay and the additions of Eras to the MyNBA mode and the Jordan Challenges make it a must-have for basketball fans. The only issue with NBA 2K23 is an old one: microtransactions. But, if you're a 2K fan, you already know that.",9
"If, like a zombie on Banoi, you've been absolutely starved for fresh meat, then Riptide might be for you. In my case, it left me with a familiar heartburn and a bad taste in my gullet.",4
"Sin Episodes: Emergence feels and plays like theater food. It’s a quick rush once you chow down, but as soon as the sugar starts digesting you start noticing things you’ve seen before.",6
"With nothing in common with the original, Yars' Revenge is a terrible bad incarnation of the original classic. Hopefully Atari will learn from this mistake and do something better the next time they decide to to a HD remake of one of their classics.",3
"A triumph of raw substance over style, Legends of Eisenwald constantly wins over the heart of the RPG connoisseur despite its incompleteness thanks to its deep battle system and well crafted adventures. A great game for strategy experts.",9
"Visually the game is absolutely stunning, with in-game character models that are at least three times as detailed as those seen in the first game. Level design is artistic as it is functional. [Nov 2003, p.32]",9
"Knowledge is Power is an entertaining quiz game, and based on my multiple playthroughs I’m yet to hit a question for the second time. It's Mario Kart-style item system ensures that most games are close, no matter the quiz knowledge. At the same time, the questions themselves are entertaining and varied enough that this one comes highly recommended for trivia heads.",8
"And so rather than allowing you to feel like an armoured avenger, Iron Man's videogame outing merely offers the chance to lurch awkwardly around the sky like a drunken wasp while holding down a button to blow stuff up.",3
"My experience with Arma III contained equal doses of pleasant surprise, delight, feeling of emptiness after finishing single player missions, and longing for more. If you’re mainly interested in the single player campaign, I advise you to wait at least for the first DLC before buying this game. [CD-Action 11/2013, p.58]",6
"Hellboy may look better than ever clutching his Samaritan revolver, but Aussie developer Krome Studios’ riff on Mike Mignola’s comic series about a crime-sleuthing demon with a wrecking ball for a right hook feels like a couple of strung-together demo levels instead of a cohesive videogame.",4
"High Hell will easily speak to every fan of the old-school FPS of the 90's. Thanks to its absurd design, Devolver's new game tastes like a nice trip of acid. The only downside to the formula is indubitably its short length, but we will gladly take those two hours of pure fun.",8
"If you’re wanting to pick up an accessible space shooter that you can casually play but has a great deal of depth, Everspace comes more than highly recommended. It’s a game that will have you hooked no matter your skill level.",8
"I can honestly say that I have a little more respect for the people who do this kind of thing everyday after playing Emergency Fire Response, and great job to Dreamcatcher in making a fun RTS game that captures excitement and enjoyment based on real life people.",8
"There is a lot to love about Dead Rising 3’s latest DLC. For $10 it is impossible not to recommend to Xbox One owners who still have the game, especially those with a fondness for classic Capcom titles.",8
"When all is said and done, Hellboy: The Science of Evil might have been a hit during the last generation of consoles. On the current consoles, though, it just falls short in nearly every regard.",4
"Ultimately, 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue has one purpose – to pave the way for Kingdom Hearts 3 – and it pulls it off incredibly well. Dream Drop Distance HD has a great story and some really cool mechanical ideas, but is let down somewhat by the limitations of the 3DS hardware it was adapted from. But 0.2 Birth by Sleep A Fragmentary Passage is just stellar. It gives the perfect taster of what to expect in Kingdom Hearts 3, while also being its own awesomely designed short-form experience. If we discount its smaller scale, 0.2 is probably one of the best instalments of the series we’ve ever had.",9
"Even with all that fanboyism, I came into this game with optimism tempered by mediocre expectations. It failed to meet even them. The game is just plain bad. It feels underdeveloped, hacked together and downright shoddy.",2
"And holy cow, if it's sheer bat-guano crazy you're after, you'll love Versus mode. Pick from 45 (!) unlockable characters and square off against 11 other nutjobs (humans or bots) in completely ridiculous battle royales over Live. We'd happily pay 10 bucks just to listen to the chaos in each wild melee.",8
"To be sure, you could critique Biomotor Unitron for not straying too far from its inspiration – and even if it borrows from Pokémon, it never comes close to matching it. But just as the ‘90s had room for second-tier competitors like Digimon, there’s no reason why Biomotor Unitron can’t exist as a fun curio today. It won’t make anyone forget Pokémon or wonder why Biomotor Unitron didn’t find more of a fanbase, but it’s fun enough that you’ll be able to enjoy it anyway.",6
"From its flawless control and presentation, to its huge amount of variety and online modes, MCII is one of the most fun and complete racing games we've ever played. [June 2003, p.24]",9
"Though playing through the main story doesn't take nearly as long as I'd like, level replays plus a two-player sabotage mode (two DS cards needed) lengthen gameplay. [Dec 2005, p.122]",6
"Superhot’s standalone expansion Mind Control Delete is a great example of how to achieve growth, drive your franchise forward and prevent an admittedly pretty basic concept from going stale. Before I knew I was ready for a change, Superhot Team thrust age-old video game tropes into gaming’s most unique shooter in ways only they could and, in a crazy twist, it works.",8
"Of all of the Vita launch titles I have been fortunate enough to play, this is honestly the easiest one to recommend. Accessible, fun, addictive, and offering lots of content, Lumines: Electronic Symphony is a superb launch title.",9
"If 400 puzzles sounds like more Sudoku than you could ever want, much less need, I highly recommend Nintendo's own ""Brain Age"" as a superior alternative. It includes only 100 puzzles, but the interface is significantly better, and you get all the Brain Age stuff in addition to Sudoku, which is really just a side offering in that game.",7
This is it. The final compilation of the enormous storytelling universe that is Kingdom Hearts. And it delivers. Especially in terms of filling some gaps in the early story while convincingly bridging games from Birth by Sleep up to Dream Drop Distance while preparing for Kingdom Hearts 3.,5
"Enjoying Hotline Miami doesn't make you a worse person, though you may find yourself wrestling with just why the act of deftly delivered murder is so damn much fun. It is because it's a lovingly crafted game, well-designed and deeply addictive.",9
"It’s easy to see why this is a cult classic. BIOMOTOR UNITRON is a retro RPG done right. While it can be something of a grind, it offers more depth than you might think. And considering an original NGPC cart commands triple-digit pricing, this eShop release is a steal at only $7.99. So, if you’re a fan of dungeon crawlers, this sci-fi take shouldn’t be missed.",9
"If you can get past Iron Man’s head-scratching learning curve, what are you left with? A game that’s far from perfect, but still better than a lot of movie and comic book tie-ins that have come before ( *wink* Catwoman).",8
"Offering slick, fast-paced gameplay, white-knuckle multiplayer, a lengthy single-player experience, and more B-movie cheese than a plate of microwave nachos, there’s a lot to like about Command & Conquer 3.",9
"I came into Lushfoil Photography Sim expecting to love it, and maybe that was a mistake. I do like it. I plan on returning to it for little escapes sometimes (emphasis on little). There is just something I love about taking a view that countless others have seen and putting your own twist on it; as it turns out, that feeling can also exist thanks to video games. Unfortunately, the camera controls never became intuitive, and accessibility around motion sickness is lacking. Lushfoil Photography Sim has a solid base, but I could never recommend it to someone without also pointing out the heavy negatives.",7
"I fear my childhood has prevented me from giving Nebuchadnezzar a fair chance. It was never going to meet my expectations because I was holding it up to a level of quality that few have been able to match in the past 20 years. This isn't a bad game; it just not one that you'll remember in a year, forget a decade. So instead of recommending this, I recommend you instead spend half as much and buy Pharoah instead.",8
"The Steam blurb for Oil Rush says it ""combines strategic challenge of classic RTS with sheer fun of Tower Defense."" But as far as I can tell there's nothing more Tower Defenseish about Oil Rush than any other RTS in which you build defensive towers -- which is pretty much all of them. I'm not sure Unigine knows what Tower Defense is.",6
"Astroy Boy assaults you with old-school charm. Factor in snazzy visuals, tight controls, and demanding difficulty, and you get a solid purchase...and one that's not just for kids. [Sept 2004, p.110]",6
"Every remark, battle cry and slash looks, sounds, and feels authentic to these characters, especially Wolverine and Sabertooth. This game will definitely put you in the spandex of your favorite spandex slasher, which by the way is not the manliest of looks.",7
Dead Cells takes some of the very best ideas from Rouge-lite and Metroidvania titles to make an action packed platformer that smartly allows the player to unravel the game's secrets.,7
"They say time heals all wounds, but free DLC can't hurt either. Dead Kings offers much for those still enamoured by the series, and its offering as a freebie is a fine gesture to anyone left aggrieved by last year's failings.",8
"Doesn't save the series, but doesn't condemn it further. Great with a co-op buddy, or if you like the score attacks. Only passable as a solo, narrative-driven experience. [May 2015, p72]",7
"Atari Flashback Classics is a decent release. Despite some small issues, it is a great way to experience the early days of video gaming. Some games may not appeal to you, while others will bring back great memories. I would have liked better emulation in some areas, and more licensed games but what we get for the price isn’t too bad at all. If you’re a fan of classic Atari, or just want to see where gaming basically began, they you should definitely check this collection out. It’s certainly not the best it could have been, but definitely not the worst classic game collection available. As a huge Atari fan, I would say it’s worth your time.",7
"Unfortunately, the end result is a game that falls somewhere in between the two extremes, and will likely satisfy neither the main-stream gamer they were trying to court, nor the hardcore strategy fan they had in their back-pocket.",5
"The campaign is quite lengthy, there is a ton of story to read through, and there’s even essentially choose-your-own-adventure stories inside other characters’ minds. However, the story is very quirky, and although developer Gust attempted to go deeper in characterization, a lot of the drama that unfolds feels at about the high school level.",6
"Capcom has come to PSVita UMVC3 well. The game is almost as large and deep as the major versions, and just as fun. Sony's new console comes with a good fighting game with this crossover.",8
"As great as the campaign is, the game will see its longest legs from multiplayer. And from the multitude of competitive match types to the addictive and strategic co-op Horde mode, what felt like a hugely entertaining afterthought in the original Gears now easily stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the campaign.",9
"While I eventually enjoyed Aporia: Beyond the Valley, the moments where bugs and glitches appeared took me right out of the experience. It’s a shame too, as the story is well told despite uttering no words at all, the premise is genuinely interesting, and the puzzles – when they work as intended – are a joy to solve. It’s certainly one to wait on for now while they tidy up all the bugs and glitches.",6
"In all honesty, the simplification of the controls and hit-miss nature of the superstar mode mean that Sega Superstar Tennis isn’t quite as good as the tennis masterclass that was ""Virtua Tennis 3.""",4
Its gameplay consists of bland beat-em-up action and imprecise gun control. The in-game visuals vary between good (up close) and bad (zoomed out) and the co-op options are limited and confusing.,3
"If you absolutely must have a Sudoku game for your Nintendo DS, I'd recommend buying a copy of ""Brain Age,"" even if it only contains one hundred puzzles. Sudoku Gridmaster is a decent game, but its problems outweigh any positives it offers.",4
"Ronin has little plot to speak of, but is focused like it’s own motorcycle helmeted avenger on a tight and tactical turn-ish-based combat mechanic. Looks a little like Gunpoint. Plays like Ronin.",6
Marlow Briggs and the Mask of the Death is an honest hack'n slash game with varied action and nice combat system. What it lacks in style and in the technical department is fully compensated for by the overall quality of the action.,7
"I literally fell asleep 15 minutes into my first ""exciting"" mission of taking pictures of fish, so that should tell you something. But stick with it, and you may find yourself inexplicably drawn in. [Mar 2003, p.116]",5
"It's a shame that such a much-loved series has come to this, but here we are. So to conclude, SingStar Ultimate Party gets one point for nice menu screens and one point for Carly Rae Jepsen.",2
"With spectacular action, great controls and a lot of emphasis on the story, Manticore: Galaxy on Fire is the best option for those who are looking to bring space battles anywhere on the Nintendo Switch.",8
"All the same, this is by far the best of the franchise so far and if you’ve ever considered giving one of the Sherlock Holmes games a go there’s been no better option to start with.",8
"Filthy Lucre strives to be a game of interesting choices between caution and gung-ho action. Unfortunately, the lack of challenge and inept AI mean that neither style of play is satisfying.",3
"It's an example of master storytellers at the height of their powers, and despite the shadow of its illustrious heritage, Final Fantasy XII is by far and away the best game in the series yet.",10
"If you've got a fondness for Hasbro's brand, High Moon Studios does not disappoint. If you played with a Transformer as a child and haven't revisited your inner 8-year-old in a few years, Fall of Cybertron will more than suffice. The latest title in the franchise won't disappoint and will provide plenty of childish, stupid fun, but it's not about to set the robotic world on fire.",7
"It's fair to say that most people over the age of about eight will find it ridiculously easy and childlike and it features some typically Manga quirks and moral dubiousness (indeed, one of the themes of the original U.S. series was vivisection!) but as a piece of history and heartwarming my-first action title, it's pleasing in almost every facet.",6
"I'm totally for the idea of a nonviolent FPS, but this one just doesn't work on any level. It's like ""Catechumen's"" long lost pagan brother. It doesn't even make a good game for your kid brother or son who's hopped up on Atlantis fever. This is one empire that deserves to stay lost.",2
"Gears of War 2 does everything you wanted the original to do and then some. I have never been so hooked on a game. I couldn't put it away until I beat it. I just couldn't get enough of the intense action, the beautiful visuals and I especially couldn't get enough of the story.",10
"All you need to know is that if it was a poker hand, Forza would be a royal flush. If a football score, it would be a 7-0 win. As a game, it is the finest straight-up racing game to grace any home console system and as such, is an absolute must buy.",10
"It's action-packed gameplay; attractive, colorful visuals; and star-studded videos are sure to draw in both hardcore fans of the series and large numbers of new players. [Apr 2007, p.20]",8
"An intriguing set but one that is downplayed significantly due to the controls. Your tolerance may vary though, so it's not a bad idea to rent this one to get the full experience for yourself before buying.",5
"Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move provides a ton of variety and a consistent level of challenge. It's a simple, accessible and entertaining puzzle game that combines Nintendo craftsmanship with a competitive price tag.",7
"Overall, however, we can only be satisfied with the outcome of the nostalgia operation implemented by Blizzard, which will once again trap fans in an endless cycle of fights to the death and unbridled looting.",9
"Arkham Knight triumphs as a richly empowering comic book fantasy that sees its hero fail almost as much as he succeeds, making him the most believable, the most occasionally unlikeable, and ultimately the most heroic he’s ever been.",10
"Switch owners may be more comfortable with playing older games than Nintendo’s less portable cousins, but even this feels a bit too short-lived and dated to satisfy our Capcom cravings, especially when there are more exciting oldies to come to Switch, from Resident Evil 4 to the recently announced Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen.",5
"Neon White is as addictive as it is challenging, with plenty of replayability and varied gameplay, looking gorgeous at every step. It's a magnificent take on the FPS-genre, building complex and thrilling levels where simply pulling the trigger isn't enough.",9
"I can’t praise Valkyria Revolution‘s story enough. It’s a clear-eyed meditation on the horrors of war – even, perhaps especially, justified war. If the developers had found a way to make the dreary, repetitive combat as worthwhile as the story that frames it, this would have been an incredible game.",8
"OutRun is just as much fun as it was when released more than two decades ago, though the gameplay fundamentals haven't changed much and the series is still in need of a bonafide relaunch. That said, I still love OutRun. I'll never get sick of Heart Attack mode.",7
"While fans of turn-based strategy might find some features to be enjoyable, long-time players of the Jagged Alliance series and strategy connoisseurs might feel shortchanged of the beloved gameplay of this genre.",5
"Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is an ambitious title and Platinum Games delivers! The resulting game is pure hack & slash, filled with interesting features like the Blade mode and the Jack the Ripper mode, that manage to make the game feel fresh and, at times, even unique. It's a joy from beginning to end and even though Revengeance isn't a long game by any stretch of the word, you won't regret spending any of your hard-earned money on it.",9
"The variety of maps, tasks and challenges is one of the strong suits of Part Time UFO. Even though the gameplay mechanics are pretty simple, clever puzzle design keeps the player entertained for many hours. [Issue#251, p.71]",8
"Most of these games translate well to the Switch, the improved graphics exploding with color. Playing in 4:3 suits some games better than others, so it’s not a perfect fit. The JoyCons are a great control tool, even if a few games struggle (I’m looking at you Sky Kid, you menace) on the Switch. This was a fun little jaunt down memory lane, but it’s really nothing more than another Namco collection in new digs.",7
"The Thaumaturge successfully delivers a weird and surprising RPG that is filled to the brim with narrative. Whether you’re chasing down demons, or manipulating the minds of the socially elite, you’ll feel the power of the Thaumaturge. With its complex turn-based combat and choice consequence system, there are plenty of opportunities for replayability.",7
"Pac-Man World: Re-PAC is a classic from the end of the 90's with improved mechanics and graphics at today's level. Those who have played the original game will be delighted with this one although they will miss the original difficulty. However, anyone can give it a try and not miss out on this classic among classics.",6
"Fuzion Frenzy 2 is like a decent-tasting smoothie of low-calorie gaming activities with a disgusting cherry on top. The game improves a lot if you’re playing at home with friends or smack-talking strangers online, but like any party, it isn’t meant to be a solo affair.",7
"The performance was solid throughout my testing, I had no issues with gameplay improvements and the graphics looked great. There were some pathfinding issues and units did enjoy clashing with one another, which made battle rather hectic, but the clunky controls and movement were among the things I loved most about the original.",8
"Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series brings together the two main games of the franchise, updating aesthetic elements and adapting details to the present time without mischaracterizing what made the series stand out in the not-so-distant past. Even with some occasional dated details, the collection is great for introducing the brand to a new generation.",8
It’s hard to believe that EA’s Madden NFL 2010 is the 5th Madden release on the Xbox 360. Each incarnation has built upon and improved on the previous. Madden 2009 made the series and the sport itself accessible to the masses – so how much room has the latest release got to move?,8
"Less enjoyable is the amazingly blatant product placement&#151;bike brands like Trek and Specialized make sense, but while you pedal, billboards for online auction sites and energy bars peddle under the guise of earnable sponsorships. Gamers will tire of it quickly.",9
"Quite a fun game, though it is a Japanese RPG so expect seemingly endless screens of dialogue that can (thankfully) be skipped through if you don't mind missing a few jokes. There is also a lot of explaining about exactly what all of the mechanics do from the Explanatory Shampuru.",6
"While the emphasis on the Batmobile late in the game can be incredibly tiring, the characters and world around you never stop propelling you forward. Combine that with the numerous upgrades for your weapons and plethora of side content available, and you have one hell of a Batman video game.",9
"Simply put, if you’re playing with a friend who’s sitting beside you on the couch – the campaign has no online co-op – you’ll likely love Revelations 2. If you’re stuck relying on the mostly-useless AI, you’re in for a far more frustrating experience.",7
"I will say that I have spent enough time on this game to encompass my two playthroughs of Mass Effect, or both of the Knights of the Old Republic titles. And I can honestly say that, in comparison, I didn’t enjoy one minute of it. Good-day.",2
"As a budget bundle, Saints Row 4: Re-elected and 'Gat out of Hell' is worth considering if you're looking to waste a few weekends before this year's influx of blockbuster releases.",6
Fans of the original Fuzion Frenzy and other party games may want to give this a rent. Everyone else will probably take part in a contest to see who can return it to the game store the fastest.,3
"Lunacy, anarchy, drastic violence and stealth tactics wrapped in absurd amounts of pixelblood and psychedelic electro. You can love this game. You can damn it into the deepest hell. But you can't ignore it.",7
"Beyond Eyes is an breathtaking accomplishment. It's a game that not only entertains, but that also gets across some of the difficulties that a differently abled person would need to contend with, in a way that is entirely understandable by everyone.",8
"In this case, I think simpler would have been better. Stripping out some of the needless camera angles and the slow-mo would make it to focus on Kill Team's strengths, like the fact that it's impressively fun to annihilate a horde of Orks with a rocket launcher. As it is, Kill Team is a reasonably fun promotional vehicle for Space Marine, but a sloppy one.",5
"Acting more as a transition episode, Batman: The Enemy Within - Episode 3 ""Fractured Mask"" is another great episode in the series, even if it isn't as fantastic as the first two. The tension is running high here and Telltale's writing is at the top of its game. If the last two episodes can live up to the first three this will easily go down as one of the developer's best.",7
"South of Midnight is Compulsion's best game by a country mile, emerging as an assured and beautifully crafted Southern Gothic folktale that feels like a bracing breath of earthy, swampy air.",8
The arcade ports are proper versions of the included games and the addition of Pac-Man Vs. and the ability to get the full multiplayer experience over two Switches with just one copy of Namco Museum is nice.,7
"The game is as homogenous and unimaginative as a tabloid cover, and is as far past its prime as Billy Dee Williams. It’s still a decent RTS, but it wins with quantity, not quality, just like Colt 45.",3
"It manages to fit some of the series' feel into one of the most generic genres ever. Unfortunately, severe play issues limit its playability, and very few gamers of any age will get to enjoy some of the extras that Tomy took the time to add in.",4
"Forced Showdown's design makes it fun to exterminate hordes of enemies for a few hours on various arenas, but later on the progress of unlocking much needed cards stalls significantly, just like our enjoyment.",5
"If you have even a remote sense of twisted humor, I highly recommend checking out this game. It is definitely the best rabbit, saw blade killing, monster slaying simulation currently available.",7
"A great game. Because of the differences from previous iterations it may be a little disappointing to die hard Mario Kart purists. But for anyone who likes the series in general, the decision to get this game is a no-brainer.",8
"Whilst very brief and slightly obsolete in its gameplay, Sunlight provides an ambitious and rich narrative experiment, offering keen insight into concepts of impermanence, sensation and mortality.",5
"For Fans of Spiderman – or of Marvel-Games in general – Spiderman Shattered Dimensions is a must-have. The perfect combination of puzzles, fights and show-downs with mighty bosses whets the player's appetite.",9
"Neon White is a love letter to turn-of-the-decade internet weirdos. It's full of rule-of-cool anime nostalgia, ear-shredding electronic music, and dialogue ripped straight out of my group chats. It's a genuine game made for an audience rarely prioritised, but even if you don't fit the archetypical person this game was made for, you're still in for the most stylish and satisfying action-platformer I've ever experienced.",8
"With the War Of The Ring turnbased campaign also receiving some minor though effective tweaks, this is one add-on pack you should snap up like a slavering Warg. Amazing what's possible when consoles don't get in the way, isn't it?",9
"Even though Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Edition outperforms its latest predecessor -- DDR SuperNova 2 -- by offering a training mode, it still falls short of the traditional DDR standard in terms of song selection, online play and visual flair.",5
"House Flipper manages to scratch a specific itch, but it lacks long-term incentives and just generally feels like a missed opportunity. With more content, polish, interactivity, and customization, this could become a nice sleeper hit. It's serviceable as is, but it won't hold your attention for too long.",4
"To each their own of course, but this game's developers probably could have put a bit more effort into Gallop Racer 2006 in order to make it more accessible for people who are curious, or just think the idea of a racing game with horses is cool. As someone who feels just like that, I can respect what Gallop Racer 2006 is about, but I'm a little disappointed too.",6
"Most of Turok 2: Seeds of Evil’s problems simply lie with the passage of time. If you are willing to overlook some of those issues, such as the outdated visuals and level design, what you will find is a fun and thrilling trip down memory lane to one of the Nintendo 64’s best first-person shooters. The lack of multiplayer, while not essential, hurts the overall package.",7
"Beyond some frustrating gameplay, Night of 100 Frights brings the visuals and sounds of the long running cartoon to life in this title, with a huge map to explore on your way to solving the mystery.",5
Kingdom Hearts fans - particularly those who can justify the game's astronomical price point of $60 for about five hours of new content - will definitely enjoy their brief time with Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue.,8
"Evotinction draws inspiration from a host of classic sci-fi influences, but flip flops between tropes and struggles to find an identity of its own. Its flat tone and atmosphere betray the beauty of its presentation, and what is really a basic story fails in many ways to hold itself together under the weight of its loftier ambitions. The action stealth certainly flirts with some interesting ideas, but a lack of balance and wonky execution unfortunately make it another imperfect cog in a machine that already has several. ChatGPT may rise up one day and decide that humans are a nuisance to be eradicated, but Evotinction fails to capture the potential horror of that.",7
Thanks to the half-decent camera you can also get right down into the action to appreciate the slaughter even more. It&#146;s worth getting Operation Genesis for this opportunity alone.,6
"While War Chest could've used better matchmaking with player match-ups and a little more variety with battle missions, it's still a fun trip through kiddie nostalgia, especially if you double down on the Hall of Fame Edition and pit G.I. Joe against He-Man. I mean, who doesn't want to see that battle happen?!",7
"I was worried Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time would be a cheap cash grab, but I was wrong. There are some flaws, but the most important aspect — the franchise’s ethos — is fully intact and on full display, making this a game that’s sure to leave fans spellbound.",6
"A game that every motorcycling lover should at least try; some small problems can somewhat undermine part of the gameplay experience, but the feelings it transmits while racing are among the best in gaming. If you love motorbike races and you're willing to forgive some frame-rate drops and other small graphical problems, you should consider it.",7
"Guardian Heroes is an idea long before its time. This high definition port embraces the past with its tweaks adding so much more enjoyment to the game, which will surely leave its loyal fan-base very happy indeed with the results. There are changes deemed only where necessary, and is made use of the 360 controller in its full. For 800 Microsoft points, this game is a bargain for fans of the late 90's classics.",4
"How To Train Your Dragon on consoles seems to suffer from a bit of an identity crisis. It wants to dabble in everything, while managing to avoid executing anything particularly well.",6
"Trek to Yomi’s opening chapter really builds expectation for what will follow, but what does follow doesn’t live up to that promise. It’s a gorgeous game to watch, but the gameplay simply falls short of matching the quality of the visuals.",5
"Those that have fond memories of GTA past and a deep patience for moving a bit backwards in the control and visuals department will be fine here, with familiarity and a good deal more than two dozen plotline missions to complete.",6
"As someone that has greatly enjoyed the previous games in the series, Toy Soldiers: War Chest is a disappointing experience. The forced use of Uplay for much of the online content, DLC purchases being locked to the account that purchased it, and a myriad of technical issues hamper the quality of the game.",5
"It’s clear that some effort certainly went into this dastardly devil’s creation, but Vergil’s Downfall leaves us wanting more; the inability to play as Vergil in the main campaign, much less the recently released Bloody Palace mode, is a puzzling omission given the precedent set with Devil May Cry 3.",4
"An addictive railway management puzzler that will scratch the itch for the logical thinking part of your brain and is very enjoyable whilst doing so. Though, for some, it may become repetitive.",5
"A combination of a streamlined length that doesn’t overstay its welcome, terrific level design, fluid controls and an overall aesthetic that’s both charming and well-integrated, Tinykin is a joy to play and an easy recommendation for any fan of 3D platformers.",8
"At a couple of quid less we’d suggest that most people think about giving it a punt (or, indeed, a jab?) but for now this will probably remain in the quite small ‘passionate about boxing, owns a Vita’ niche.",5
"I think Rock of Ages 2: Bigger and Boulder is pretty fantastic, and well-worth playing. I was genuinely surprised that a sequel was even made, but I’m happy to see that ACE Team managed to recapture all of the magic from the first, and expand on it even more.",8
"Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition perfects and fine-tunes one of the most venerated RPGs of the last decade. While the English voice acting and the occasional resolution dip is disappointing, they made such a meaningless difference that it didn't matter in the end. The gorgeous visual upgrade, the wide and varied locations, the deeply entertaining battle system, and the exquisite soundtrack all add together to one of the best RPG experiences possible.",10
"A realistic flight sim. Sometimes realistic games can drive people away, which is what Aero Elite did for me. Most of the time I was doing nothing but trying to get in range of my target, then shot a missile.",3
"Firefall probably is the most innovative MMO of the last period, whose indisputable merits are, however, counterbalanced by significant technical gaps as well as a general flatness of end-game contents. Worth much, but it could've been even better.",3
"Batman: Arkham Knight is a game that shows what can happen when a talented development studio is completely invested in a fictional universe and has mastered the technology to bring it to life. We’ve become the Batman before, but never quite like this.",3
"The vehicles have a silly propensity to flip upside-down (even at 20mph), and stupid proportional gaffes abound, like a dune buggy that's able to muscle an SUV over a cliff. Which is just insane.",3
"Supreme fan service, an epic sense of scale and plenty of gameplay variety ensure that Transformers: Fall of Cybertron is not only an unreservedly brilliant sequel, but is inarguably the best Transformers game we've played.",3
"If you haven't played the original title, you must play Xenoblade Chrinicles: Definitive edition. If you enjoyed this masterpiece of the JRPG you must play this new version, not only for their upgraded graphics, but also for the epilogue. This is a must buy in all the sections.",3
"The game will clearly appeal more to casual gamers than to the hardcore, but it does show how the Wii U can deliver interesting games when the developers try to introduce some innovation.",3
"In closing, Dark Sector has familiar gameplay to Gears of War, using the cover system, perspective and excessive bloodshed, but it's addition of abilities helps animate the darkened world.",3
"Old-schoolers who cut their teeth on the original Bros. have a lot to enjoy in Super Princess Peach, while new players will find an excellent and challenging introduction into one of gaming's most venerable and popular genres.",3
"Legends of Eisenwald will certainly offer tens if not hundreds of hours of fun for those who are willing to understand its world and mechanics, and it will be interesting to see how the team at Aterdux expands the formula of the game in the future.",3
"You will love EA Sports FC 25 and hate it at the same time – just like every previous installment. Nevertheless, the FC IQ system makes me feel, for the first time in a while in this series, the big potential for customizing tactics and individual player roles.",3
"Its gameplay mechanics are at best, boring, and at worst, snooze-worthy. If you enjoy Neopets, you may want to give this one a tentative rent, but that’s the most that I can suggest to anyone.",3
Box Boy! is a game that reminds us of the golden age of the Game Boy. Its level and gameplay design really shine and remind us the reasons why Nintendo became a leader in this market at various stages of its history.,3
"Even if we aren’t getting Kingdom Hearts 3 anytime soon, you’re finally able to play one of the series great titles at long last on the PS4, and see how the future of the series is shaping up.",3
There's no doubt that NCAA Football 06 lives up to the pre-release hype and keeps the dynasty going by staying on top and garnering yet another title as the best college football game around.,3
"Technically there's nothing wrong with the game -- had it released in 2006. While it's great to have Visual Concepts back, they definitely left room for improvement for All-Pro Football 2K9, and improvement is certainly what's needed for this next generation of football games.",3
The episodic concept worked well already in Crimes & Punishments and serves its purpose here as well. Even with the low difficulty level spending the time with the sleuth was worthwhile.,3
"If you're a dedicated fan of the Shadowrun setting and enjoy your games a little on the complex side, you will be disappointed in the lack of depth in Shadowrun Chronicles. If, however, you enjoy turn-based tactical action and cooperative multiplayer, you might have a blast with the game.",3
"Full of gags, bawdy humour and pratfalls (what other game gives you the chance to shoot bananas at the feet of citizens for comic relief?) it's got charm to spare. Unlike Sakaguchi's biggest hit, The Last Story's title is more likely to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, but it represents compelling proof that there's still life in the old JRPG yet.",3
"A Space for the Unbound rotates between visual novel scenes, fetch quests, quick-time-event fights and increasingly complex puzzles. It moves along at a steady pace, but gives space for the player to breathe when things get heavy. There's always a stray cat to pet if you need a moment to recover.",3
"Close to the Sun is one of the best examples of the “walking simulator” style of adventure game I’ve seen in quite some time. It does a wonderful job of blending the visual style of BioShock with the tense atmosphere of Outlast and slow-paced world-building of Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture. While the sometimes-obtuse puzzles and slow pacing can cause frustration and repetition, this is a harrowing and thoughtfully designed adventure from start to finish.",3
"Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series certainly is the best way for the series to celebrate its 25th anniversary, as with the great improvements it has received, the series is back in the spotlight. The only thing that remains to be seen is what the future holds for the franchise.",3
"Despite minor complaints and moments of awkwardly forced titillation that nearly wreck its somber and engrossing atmosphere, Last Light proves exhilarating, haunting, and one of the best-looking games ever.",3
"NSMBW is a stunning game in single-player, and a chaotic barrel of light-hearted laughs in multiplayer, accessible to beginners while truly challenging to long-term fans. Well done, Nintendo.",3
"Onimusha: Warlords for Nintendo Switch is a delight. It looks and plays well, it’s fun, and the in-game achievement system – aptly named Honors – motivates the player to replay the game several times. On average, most will be able to complete the game in around four hours. Despite the short duration, the journey is a quality one and something you’ll want to replay. Hopefully, Capcom has plans to bring the rest of the Onimusha series to the Nintendo Switch in the near future.",3
"BOXBOY! is just so pure, so perfect a puzzler that I wish it had existed way back when, so that in some alternate timeline I would have been able to play decades' worth of sequels to it by now. It's that good. [Issue #15; May/June 2015, p.25]",3
"It's harder than most, but the feeling of elation when you finally work those punk-ass CPU roadsters into submission is legendary. Rockstar's latest above-the-law offering is excellent.",3
"While the story is subpar, the stealth mechanics are weak, and the lack of a dodge ability does hinder a solid combat system, this short game–clocking in at around seven to eight hours–is certainly entertaining to play.",3
"A short, sweet season of story let down by the choice of form. We respect the experimental interpolation, though perhaps they should’ve played this piece straight. [Issue#19, p.87]",3
"Vast, beautiful, and every bit as epic as its subject matter, Troy's designation as a 'Saga' doesn't reflect a brief spin-off, but a soaring remix of the Iliad, with just the occasional annoyance or backwards step.",3
"Characters are memorable and well drawn, literally and figuratively, and the game ably tackles thorny issues such as the consequences of school bullying, and the terrible toll taken by anxiety, depression and domestic abuse. For the most part, the 12-hour runtime flies by as you get to know every delightful nook and cranny of the cosy neighbourhood; only the final third drags a little. It feels worthwhile after the superb ending, though, which ensures that this game will live on in your memory for a long, long time after the credits roll.",3
"Yonder has some interesting aspects to it, and while they really tried to throw in everything and the kitchen sink into it minus combat, many of them fall flat or shallow. The exploration is the best part of the game by far, and while the other parts of the game may be to shallow for me, others may find enjoyment out of them. Even then, the pacing is well done and players will have a pretty view the entire time. I’d say wait for price drop, but when that happens check it out.",3
"An excellent downhill bike racing game that gives you an amazing sense of speed, anxiousness, great control over your character and changing weather as you go from the top of the mountain to the bottom.",3
"If you're a mainstream gamer, we have no reason to recommend Telltale's Game of Throne as it's far from being the best game of the studio. On the other hand if you're a fanatic of R.R. Martin's books you won't regret your purchase as it's better than the HBO series.",3
"Following to the letter its own formula in terms of gameplay, controls, structure and open world design, Forza Horizon 5 becomes the new pinnacle of the franchise due to the special way that it transports us to the beautiful Mexican landscapes, taking harnessing all the power of the Xbox Series X to become one of the first games of this new generation that undoubtedly feels like a new generation. Some rough edges at the level and interface and progression slow it down from true perfection, but its virtues overshadow those flaws and of course, make it one of the best games of this 2021.",3
"Look beyond the tattered edges, though, and there's enough to ensure that the monopoly on two-wheel racing Milestone now enjoys doesn't mean this wins out by default. MotoGP 13's a lean, scrappy racer that's not just the best motorbike game around at the moment - it's one of the best pure motorsport experiences on console for years.",3
"Troy is a step in the right direction, polishing and improving many aspects of the series. We’ll have to wait to the next main entry in the franchise, but until then it is a game worth your time.",3
"For Formula 1 lovers, the ""Classic"" mode alone justifies the purchase of this 2013 edition, as Codemasters has managed to create a second game in the heart of a simulation that was already a reference. The best F1 races of yesterday and today are transcribed in a game that breathes the passion and love for this motorsport.",3
"The simple and scaled down options seem to be made for newer players into this kind of market, but the confusing nature of the game if you don't play the campaign first can quickly get frustrating.",3
"Those previously unaware of Time Crisis will find the whole affair bafflingly cheesy, but devotees of the franchise will love Razing Storm as a package, although most will surely agree that it should have been billed as Deadstorm Pirates, with a free copy of Time Crisis: Razing Storm thrown in.",3
