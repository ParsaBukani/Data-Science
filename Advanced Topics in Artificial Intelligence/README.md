# Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence

_Data Science — University of Tehran_

This folder contains the fifth and sixth assignments of the **Data Science course**, focused on **advanced AI and machine learning topics**.  
The projects span multiple domains, including **semi-supervised learning, semantic search, reasoning with large language models, and unsupervised image segmentation**.

## Overview

- **Game Review Prediction (Semi-Supervised Learning)**  
  Predict video game review scores using limited labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled text. Methods include **self-training, label propagation, and active learning**.

- **Semantic Search (Persian Q&A)**  
  Build a search engine for Persian-language Q&A data. Use **embedding models, vector databases, and reranking strategies** to deliver semantically relevant results.

- **Reasoning with LLMs (SWAG Dataset)**  
  Apply **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to solve multiple-choice reasoning tasks. Experiment with **in-context learning, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering** to evaluate model performance.

- **Image Segmentation (Clustering-Based)**  
  Perform **unsupervised semantic segmentation** of football player images using clustering methods (K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative). Evaluate segmentation using **IoU** and **Dice coefficient**.
