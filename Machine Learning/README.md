# Machine Learning Applications

_Data Science — University of Tehran_

This folder contains the third set of projects from the **Data Science course**, focused on applying **classical machine learning algorithms** to real-world problems.  
Each task was evaluated through a dedicated **Kaggle competition**, emphasizing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development without the use of deep learning.

## Overview

- **Cancer Survival Classification**  
  A binary classification model to predict whether a cancer patient survives, based on demographic, diagnostic, and treatment features.

- **Bike Rental Regression**  
  A regression model to forecast the daily number of bike rentals using weather, seasonal, and calendar-related attributes.

- **Movie Recommendation System**  
  A recommendation model predicting user–movie ratings by leveraging user–item interactions and trust-based relationships.
