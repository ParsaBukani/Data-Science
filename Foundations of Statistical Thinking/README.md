# Foundations of Statistical Thinking

_Data Science — University of Tehran_

This folder contains the first set of projects from the **Data Science course**, focusing on fundamental concepts of **statistical inference, probability, and hypothesis testing**.  
The assignments combine simulation, real-world data analysis, and statistical validation to build strong foundations for applied data science.

## Overview

- **Roulette Simulation**  
  Monte Carlo methods are used to simulate betting strategies and analyze expected winnings. Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is applied to study convergence and casino profitability.

- **Election Prediction (2016 U.S. Presidential Election)**  
  Polling data is aggregated to estimate voter proportions, compute confidence intervals, and perform hypothesis testing to evaluate the spread between candidates.

- **Drug Safety Test**  
  Clinical trial data is analyzed to compare **drug vs. placebo** groups across multiple health metrics, using independent **t-tests** for statistical validation.
