# Introduction to Data Science

This repository contains a series of projects developed for the course  
**“Data Science”**, offered by the  
**Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering**,  
**University of Tehran – Spring 1403-1404**,  
under the supervision of **Dr. Bahrak** and **Dr. Yaghoobzadeh**.

## Overview

This course provides a comprehensive journey through the **data science pipeline**, starting from theoretical foundations and moving towards advanced AI applications.  

- It begins with **statistical thinking**, where simulation, inference, and hypothesis testing are applied to real-world scenarios such as casino games, election forecasting, and clinical trials.  
- Next, we explore **sampling algorithms** and **data visualization**, including Langevin dynamics and interactive dashboards.  
- The course then shifts to **real-time analytics**, building a complete pipeline with Kafka and Spark for streaming data ingestion and fraud detection.  
- In the **machine learning** module, students tackle three Kaggle competitions covering classification, regression, and recommendation systems.  
- The **deep learning projects** extend this foundation with MLPs for sports forecasting, CNNs for image classification, and RNNs for time-series prediction.  
- **Advanced AI topics** introduce semi-supervised learning, semantic search in Persian Q&A datasets, reasoning with large language models, and unsupervised image segmentation.  
- Finally, the **capstone project** applies all these skills to a practical **Car License Plate Detection** system, integrating dataset management, feature engineering, deep learning models, and OCR evaluation.
